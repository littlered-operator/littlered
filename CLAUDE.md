# LittleRed - LLM Startup Guide

Welcome! This document provides a high-level, condensed overview of the LittleRed project to help you get up to speed quickly and contribute effectively.

---

## 1. Project Essence
**LittleRed** is a lightweight Kubernetes operator for deploying and managing **Redis/Valkey** as a high-performance, pure in-memory store. It is built using the **Kubebuilder** framework.

### Core Philosophy
- **Pure In-Memory**: Designed for speed and simplicity. No persistence (RDB/AOF) is ever enabled by default, not even "by accident" for internal metadata.
- **No Eviction by Default**: Follows a strict `noeviction` policy unless the user explicitly configures otherwise. It acts as a reliable in-memory data store that doesn't "forget" data under memory pressure.
- **Cloud Native**: Leverages Kubernetes primitives (StatefulSets, Services) while handling Redis-specific cluster logic in the operator.

---

## 2. Terminology

"Cluster" is overloaded in the Redis world. Always use these terms to avoid ambiguity:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **instance** | Any LittleRed-managed Redis deployment, regardless of mode |
| **standalone** | A single Redis pod (`mode: standalone`) |
| **sentinel** | The HA mode: 3 Redis pods (1 master + 2 replicas) monitored by 3 sentinel processes (`mode: sentinel`) |
| **sentinels** | The 3 monitoring processes within a sentinel instance specifically |
| **failover** | The operator-managed HA mode: 1 Redis master + N replicas, **no Sentinel processes** — the operator is the failure detector and failover decider (`mode: failover`, experimental) |
| **Redis Cluster** | The gossip-based sharding mode (`mode: cluster`) |

**Rules:**
- "Cluster" on its own always means Redis Cluster mode — never use it as a generic synonym for "a Redis deployment."
- "Instance" is the generic term for any LittleRed deployment.
- Do not say "sentinel cluster" — it's ambiguous (could mean the whole sentinel setup, or the sentinel processes themselves).
- Do not call LittleRed "optimized for caching" — the default policy is `noeviction`, not LRU/LFU. It is a general-purpose in-memory store.

## 3. Architectural Pillars

### 3.1 Strictly No Persistence
- **Decision**: Persistence (RDB/AOF) is **actively disabled** across all components.
- **Rationale**: Eliminates dependencies on PersistentVolumes (PVCs), simplifies disaster recovery, and ensures predictable performance.
- **Implication**: Pod restarts result in a clean slate. Data durability is achieved via replication (Sentinel/Cluster modes) across live nodes, never via disk.

### 3.2 Default 'noeviction' Policy
- **Decision**: The default `maxmemory-policy` is `noeviction`.
- **Rationale**: Provides an "honest" data store behavior where memory exhaustion results in errors rather than silent data loss (eviction).
- **Instruction**: Avoid calling the project "optimized for caching" to prevent users from assuming a default LRU/LFU policy. It is a general-purpose in-memory store.

### 3.3 Resource Defaults
- **Decision**: Memory `limits` equal `requests` by default (preventing OOM surprises). No CPU limit by default. Set the CPU *request* to match the instance's thread budget; users can add an explicit CPU limit for Guaranteed QoS if their platform requires it.
- **Rationale**: Redis's CPU consumption is **bounded by its thread count**, not unbounded — command execution runs on a single main thread, plus a configurable set of `io-threads` for socket reads/writes and protocol parsing (the `io-threads` count *includes* the main thread; since Redis 6.0 it offloads I/O, and Redis 8 always threads both reads and writes when `io-threads > 1` — `io-threads-do-reads` is obsolete there — but command execution stays single-threaded). Because Redis can't exceed its thread budget, a CPU *limit* has no upside: it can only throttle Redis under load, which turns into rising latency, request pile-up, and cascading timeouts in dependent services. Size the CPU *request* to the thread budget instead. Memory must still be bounded to protect the node.

### 3.4 Kubernetes as "Source of Truth"
- **Decision**: For Cluster mode, the operator uses the Kubernetes Pod list to detect "ghost" nodes.
- **Rationale**: Redis gossip can lag (up to 15s+). Knowing a Pod is gone via the K8s API allows immediate `CLUSTER FORGET` and faster healing.

### 3.5 Minimal Interference (Enablement over Intervention)
- **Philosophy**: Trust and enable Redis's internal mechanisms (Gossip, Sentinel) to handle their own state transitions. Don't "work against" them or attempt to "accelerate" their built-in timers (like `cluster-node-timeout`) unless absolutely necessary.
- **When to Intervene**:
    1. **Loss of Quorum**: When Redis cannot self-heal because it lacks a majority (e.g., `CLUSTER FAILOVER TAKEOVER`).
    2. **Deadlocks**: When a specific failure sequence prevents auto-recovery (e.g., a master failing before a replica has fully synced).
    3. **External Knowledge**: When the operator knows something Redis doesn't (e.g., "The Pod for this NodeID is deleted from K8s, it's never coming back").
- **Key Goal**: Support the internal workings of Sentinel and Gossip, only "helping" when a permanent stall or cluster-wide failure is detected.

### 3.6 Safe Bootstrap (Sentinel Mode)
- **Decision**: Uses `status.bootstrapRequired` and Operator-led registration in Sentinel.
- **Rationale**: Prevents empty restarted masters from wiping data on live replicas via full sync by strictly authorizing mastership via Sentinel.
- **Instruction**: All Redis pods must start in a wait-loop querying Sentinel until a master is assigned by the Operator.

### 3.7 Strict IP-Only Identity (Sentinel Mode)
- **Decision**: Sentinel and Redis nodes strictly use **Pod IPs** for identification, with hostname announcement and resolution explicitly disabled.
- **Rationale**: In a pure in-memory architecture, a pod restart results in total data loss. By using ephemeral IPs, a restarted pod (with a new IP) is treated as a completely new node by Sentinel. This prevents "Ghost Masters" (empty pods reclaimed as masters) and eliminates DNS-related race conditions during failover.
- **Implication**: Any transition to persistent storage (PVCs) will require a pivot to stable Podname-based identities. (See ADR-001)

### 3.8 Discovery Deadlock Prevention (Sentinel Mode)
- **Decision**: Removed `PING` connectivity check from the Redis startup script. (See ADR-002)
- **Rationale**: Replicas must start `redis-server` even if the reported master is unreachable. This allows them to register with Sentinel as living replicas, enabling Sentinel to perform a failover when the master is dead. Keeping the `PING` check leads to a deadlock where no replicas ever start because they are waiting for a master that Sentinel hasn't promoted yet.
- **Assumed Risk**: We assume Redis/Valkey handles unreachable masters gracefully at startup via standard retry logic.

### 3.9 Ghost Node Healing (Sentinel Mode)
- **Decision**: Proactively correct dead IPs from Sentinel's topology; strategy differs for ghost replicas vs ghost masters.
- **Ghost replicas**: When dead pod IPs appear in Sentinel's *replica* list, issue `SENTINEL RESET` (broadcast to all sentinels). This clears the stale entries without directing Sentinel to any specific master. Only applied after Rule A passes (no terminating pods, no active failover) and the consensus master is a verified living pod.
- **Ghost master** (LR-008): A dual-failover race can leave a sentinel permanently stuck monitoring a ghost master IP — it cannot reach `o_down` alone and cannot self-correct. `SENTINEL RESET` was tried first (LR-007) but found ineffective: RESET clears replica/sentinel lists but does **not** change the monitored master IP; the sentinel reconnects to the same ghost. The correct fix (LR-008) is `SENTINEL REMOVE` followed by `SENTINEL MONITOR <consensus-master-IP>` — this forces the sentinel to immediately point at the correct living master. Applied only after Rule A passes. See ADR-003 and `docs/RECONCILIATION_ALGORITHM_CHANGELOG.md` (LR-007, LR-008).

### 3.10 Leaderless Bootstrap-Deadlock Recovery (Sentinel Mode)
- **Decision**: The operator self-heals a *leaderless bootstrap deadlock* — the state where every Sentinel is bare (reachable but monitoring nothing) and no reachable Redis node is a master, so `RealMasterIP == ""` and every consensus-master-gated rule short-circuits. This happens on a mass pod restart of an already-initialized instance, because `bootstrapRequired` is set only once (at `Phase == ""`) and never re-armed. (See ADR-005, changelog LR-015.)
- **Rule L** (`recoverLeaderlessDeadlock`) is the *only* rule that runs while leaderless, and is deliberately conservative: it fires only when all reachable Sentinels are bare (distinguishing a bootstrap deadlock from a recent master death, where Sentinels still monitor the dead master and can fail over), a reachable Sentinel quorum exists, Rule A passes, and the state has persisted past a 30s cooldown (`status.leaderlessSince`).
- **Data safety** (keyed on the count of reachable pods holding keys — `RedisNodeState.Keys`, gathered via full `INFO`): **0 holders** → seed `redis-0`. **Exactly 1 holder** → promote that pod (it's a surviving replica of a dead master; nothing else has data to lose) — safe, no opt-in. **≥2 holders** → electing one discards the others, so **refuse** unless `sentinel.allowUnsafeRebootstrapOnDeadlock` is set, in which case force-elect the most-complete pod (`BestDataHolder`: highest offset, tiebreak keys). Electing a running replica issues `REPLICAOF NO ONE` to promote it (`electMaster`); an unreachable/wait-looping elect starts fresh as master via its startup script.
- **Probes make no topology decisions** (LR-016): the sentinel Redis **liveness** probe is a plain local health check (bootstrap guard + local `PING`), like standalone and cluster mode. It must *not* restart a replica because its master is unreachable — during a leaderless deadlock that would wipe the very survivor data Rule L preserves (storage is EmptyDir). A masterless replica is healthy-and-waiting: **Rule R** (LR-009) redirects it via `SLAVEOF` when a consensus master exists, **Rule L** preserves/promotes it when none does. The **readiness** probe still requires `link:up`, so such a replica is pulled from traffic without being killed.
- **Ghost-master variant** (LR-024): the same "no living master, survivors present" recovery, but for when the Sentinels are *not* bare — a majority monitor a **ghost** master (a dead master IP) with no promotable replica, so failover aborts `no-good-slave` forever while survivors hold data. This falls in the gap between LR-008 ghost-*master* correction (needs a living consensus master) and Rule L (needs *bare* Sentinels), so a dedicated rule owns it. `recoverGhostMasterDeadlock` (pure `planGhostMasterRecovery`, sibling of Rule L) fires on `SentinelsMonitorGhostMaster` + `!HasHealthyKnownReplica` (the discriminator from a *recent* master death, where a legitimate failover is still imminent) + reachable quorum + a 30s `status.ghostMasterStuckSince` cooldown, and elects the most-complete survivor via `electMaster`. Its safety gate is replication **lineage** (`holdersDiverged`: union-find over `master_replid` *and* `master_replid2`), **not** Rule L's holder count — same-lineage survivors, including a normal post-failover **promotion chain** (a promoted node rotates `master_replid`, old → `master_replid2`), elect with no opt-in; only genuinely independent lineages need `allowUnsafeRebootstrapOnDeadlock`. The *self-inflicted* trigger — the ghost-**replica** `SENTINEL RESET` (Rule D) — is left in place for now; retiring/rate-limiting it is the deferred *prevention* half (ADR-010 pending, see `docs/GHOST_MASTER_FAILOVER_DEADLOCK_DESIGN.md`). Source-confirmed (Redis + Valkey `sentinel.c`): no surgical single-ghost prune exists and a dead replica never ages out, so this deadlock is only reachable via, and only recoverable *after*, a whole-list RESET.

### 3.11 Consolidated-Shard Reshard Recovery (Cluster Mode)
- **Decision**: The operator self-heals a *consolidated-shard deadlock* — the state where one master owns more than one shard's slot range while other masters sit slotless (empty), so `CountMasters() < shards` yet all slots are assigned. No prior repair step could act (Step 3 only checks each range has *an* owner, not a *distinct* one; Step 4 only reattaches empties to under-replicated slot-masters), so the instance stuck in `Initializing` forever. (See ADR-006, changelog LR-018.)
- **Step 3b** (`reshardConsolidated`, driven by the pure `PlanReshard`): relocate the surplus range off the over-consolidated master onto a reachable empty master, **preserving keys unconditionally**. Distinctness-only destination choice; defers on fragmented ranges / no empty master / healthy. The cause is also closed in Step 3: `SafeMissingShardTarget` restricts missing-shard assignment to a reachable *empty* master, so recovery never piles a second range onto a master that already owns one (the drift that created the state).
- **No drop-keys opt-in** (contrast ADR-005's `allowUnsafeRebootstrapOnDeadlock`): a key-preserving reshard always exists here, so a lossy path is never necessary and none is built.
- **Mechanism by free capability probe**: Redis 8.4+ ⇒ native atomic slot migration (`CLUSTER MIGRATION IMPORT`); pre-8.4 ⇒ the incremental `reshardViaDance` (mark IMPORTING/MIGRATING → drain bounded key batches per reconcile → flip `SETSLOT NODE` only when fully drained, resuming from on-node markers, no persisted state). Support is detected from the `cluster_slot_migration_*` fields in the `CLUSTER INFO` already gathered (AND over reachable nodes) — **nothing is persisted**; a status field is a monitoring surface and an internal capability does not belong there. Tunables `spec.cluster.reshard{KeyBatchSize,MaxKeysPerReconcile,MigrateTimeoutMillis}`.
- **Corollary** (LR-018): the dance is the first path that marks slots IMPORTING/MIGRATING; it exposed a latent `ParseClusterNodes` bug (the `[slot->-id]`/`[slot-<-id]` notations were parsed as owned slots) — now excluded.

### 3.12 Per-Shard StatefulSets & Stable Shard Identity (Cluster Mode)
- **Decision** (0.3.0, breaking): cluster mode is **one StatefulSet per shard** — `{name}-shard-K` (K in `0..shards-1`), each sized `1+replicasPerShard`, stamping a static `redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/shard: "<K>"` identity label. Shard K's master is `{name}-shard-K-0`; `-1..R` are its replicas. This replaces the pre-0.3.0 single `{name}-cluster` STS and its striped pod-index→shard model (pod N = shard N; replicas via `(i-shards)%shards`). The pure `ClusterPodRefs(name, shards, replicasPerShard)` is the single source of truth for pod enumeration + master identity. (See ADR-007, changelog LR-020.)
- **Why mandatory, not cosmetic**: the must-have is single-domain-loss survivability (a shard's master + replica never share a node/zone — durability *is* domain diversity under EmptyDir, pillar 3.1). A `topologySpreadConstraint` needs a *stable, schedule-time, per-shard* selector. A single STS cannot provide one: one `spec.template` ⇒ pods stamped identically; the only per-pod labels K8s injects are ordinal/revision identity (`pod-index`, `pod-name`, `controller-revision-hash`), never shard-semantic; operator-patched labels land after scheduling (`IgnoredDuringExecution`). **One template ⇒ no schedule-time shard key ⇒ only a bespoke mutating webhook could fake it.** Per-shard STSs express it declaratively — and additionally make the shard the *workload unit* (per-shard rolling updates, per-shard PDB) and delete the fragile pod-index→shard decode that caused LR-018.
- **Shared Services stay shard-agnostic**: the one headless Service `{name}-cluster` (selector `component=cluster`) governs every shard STS (`serviceName`), so peer discovery + pod DNS `{pod}.{name}-cluster.ns.svc` resolve across all shards; only shard STS *selectors* carry the shard label. One PDB per shard (`{name}-shard-K-pdb`, redundant shards only).
- **Operator is sole topology authority (A is NOT free — LR-020 e2e finding).** Stable *pod* identity is necessary but insufficient: OSS Redis/Valkey Cluster has **no failure-domain awareness** (Enterprise-only; Valkey AZ = client read routing), and both the operator's Step 4 reattach *and* Redis's autonomous replica migration re-pair a shard's master/replica **across** StatefulSets, topology-blind (observed scrambling the pairing at bootstrap). So per-shard placement holds only because the operator pins each Redis shard inside one STS: **(1) shard-aware reattach** (`chooseReattachTarget` — attach an empty pod to the under-replicated master in *its own* shard) and **(2) `cluster-allow-replica-migration no`** in the cluster config. A thin slice of Direction B that A requires. **Rollout serialization (LR-021):** `reconcileClusterStatefulSet` applies template *updates* one shard at a time (create-missing stays parallel), gating the next shard on the current one settling (`clusterShardRolloutSettled`; change detected via `AnnotationPodSpecHash`). Without it, a config change rolls all shards in parallel and restarts every master in one wave (an availability dip, not data loss — `corruptions:0`). Governs only operator-triggered rollouts; a manual `kubectl rollout restart` bypasses it.
- **Never delete data** (pillar continuity): the split renames workloads (EmptyDir clean slate), so the operator refuses rather than auto-deletes — a lingering legacy `{name}-cluster` STS ⇒ `LegacyClusterTopology` condition + wait; a `shards` decrease ⇒ `ShardScaleDownRefused`. In-place upgrade from pre-0.3.0 is unsupported (documented clean-slate migration).
- **Placement knob (Milestone 2, LR-022)**: `spec.placement.shardAntiAffinity {topologyKey, whenUnsatisfiable}` — the operator injects a **per-shard** `topologySpreadConstraint` (`maxSkew:1`, selector = that shard's pods via the shard label) into each shard STS, appended to any `spec.podTemplate.topologySpreadConstraints` (`buildShardSpreadConstraint`). Defaults `kubernetes.io/hostname` + **`ScheduleAnyway` (soft)** (CNPG/Strimzi convention, pillar 3.5); `DoNotSchedule` is opt-in. This is what actually makes Goal 1 (master/replica never share a domain) usable — the per-shard STS split only made it *expressible*. Cluster-mode only (validation rejects it elsewhere).
- **Scope**: Direction A is complete (Milestone 1 split + Milestone 2 placement knob). Deferred: the under-provisioning status condition (needs cluster-wide `nodes` RBAC). Direction B (topology-aware master balancing) is **declined** (ADR-009, a challenge surface) — reads commonly go to replicas so load is already spread, `replicasPerShard:1` has no balancing freedom, there is no schedule-time master label, and active balancing only costs failover churn. Sentinel/standalone need neither (sentinel's single STS already spreads its three data pods).

### 3.13 Total-/Partial-Wipe Re-Bootstrap (Cluster Mode)
- **Decision**: The operator self-heals a *cluster total-/partial-wipe deadlock* — the cluster analog of the sentinel leaderless deadlock (pillar 3.10). When every pod is lost at once, recovery splits by EmptyDir fate: a **pod-delete wipe** (node recycle/eviction) returns all pods fresh+isolated and self-heals through the normal repair loop (MEET → assign-missing-to-fresh-intended-master → shard-aware reattach), never reaching `bootstrapCluster`. A **mass container-crash** (kill-9/OOM) keeps `nodes.conf` on the surviving EmptyDir, so every restarted master parks in the startup STEP-3 yield loop (LR-003) with no live replica to fail over to → `CrashLoopBackOff`, never Ready → the operator (gated on `allPodsReady`) is blind. (See ADR-008, changelog LR-023.)
- **Fix — operator-owned, not script-owned**: `recoverClusterWipeDeadlock` (pure `planClusterWipeRecovery`) runs in the not-all-Ready branch and **recycles** (deletes) exactly the stuck pods so their StatefulSets reschedule them fresh (clean EmptyDir → new node ID); the pod-delete self-heal path then re-bootstraps. The startup script is unchanged (keeps its conservative yield/park — a parked pod can't distinguish a total wipe from a temporarily-unreachable live replica; that needs the global view, echoing LR-016).
- **Data safety by construction**: recyclable = redis container **not-Ready + crash-looping (restarted) + not OOMKilled**, gated by a 120s `status.cluster.wipeDeadlockSince` cooldown (mirrors `LeaderlessSince`). The safety gate is the **kubelet's local readiness probe** (authoritative, blackhole-proof — *not* the operator's remote dial, which LR-017 showed a blackhole can fool): in a pure in-memory cluster a not-Ready redis holds no data, so deleting it loses nothing. A **Ready** pod (a possible data holder) is **never** recycled, so a partial wipe with a surviving replica keeps it (Step 0/1 promotes it). No `allowUnsafeRebootstrap` analog is needed (a total wipe has zero data holders: cluster data ⟺ slot ownership).

### 3.14 Operator-Managed Failover (Failover Mode)
- **Decision** (ADR-011, ships **experimental**): a fourth mode, `failover` — 1 master + `spec.failover.replicas` replicas (default 2, the first configurable replica count), **no Sentinel processes**. The operator is the sole failure detector and failover decider, removing the "two cooks" problem class (operator and Sentinel as independent failure-detectors fighting over the same state — the LR-007/LR-008 saga, the LR-024 self-inflicted deadlock, the whole ADR-010 ghost-replica subject). The label-routed master Service is unchanged: the operator's `role: master` label was already the effective writer-routing authority; Sentinel was a second, sometimes-conflicting one. Accepted trade-off: **HA is coupled to operator liveness** (sentinel mode's *hard* failures already depended on the operator). `sentinel` stays fully supported on feature-completeness grounds; `failover` is offered neutrally as validated-by-our-own-use added value, not pushed.
- **Intent from annotations** (pillar 3.6 kept, Sentinel replaced): the operator stamps `redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/assigned-role` / `assigned-master-ip` / `assignment-epoch` annotations on each data pod; the pod reads its own annotations back through a **downward-API volume** and only then `exec`s `redis-server` (no API-server access from data pods). The annotations ARE the intent record — re-derived from the pod list every pass (`resolveFailoverIntent`: master = highest-epoch master assignment), never read back from status (ADR-006). `status.failover.*` (`masterDownSince`, `assignmentEpoch`, `transitionSince`) is monitoring surface only; nothing load-bearing is persisted.
- **Epoch-fenced kill-9 yield** (the ADR-001 same-IP hazard, re-owned): before `exec` the startup script writes the consumed epoch to an EmptyDir run-marker; a container restart (same pod, same IP, wiped dataset) replays the same annotations, but the marker marks them consumed, so the pod **parks in the wait-loop — parking IS the yield**. Only an operator epoch bump (its global view failing over to a data holder, or re-authorizing when nothing holds data) releases it. No reachability check before starting as replica (ADR-002's deadlock constraint).
- **Corroborated death detection** (pure `planMasterDeath`): (a) **K8s-authoritative** — master pod gone/replaced, redis container not-Ready per kubelet, or terminating (graceful handover: the operator promotes proactively during the grace window; the preStop hook only sleeps) → dead **immediately** (kubelet readiness is the blackhole-proof signal, ADR-008); (b) **probe-evidenced, corroborated** — operator-unreachable ≥ `downAfterMilliseconds` AND every reachable replica reports `link:down` (LR-017 lesson: the operator's own dial is never sufficient evidence). A replica still seeing `link:up`, or no reachable replica to corroborate → HOLD: the marker is kept (the timer never resets on a veto) but nothing is declared.
- **One decision table** (pure `planFailover`) replaces the three sentinel-mode rules (bootstrap, Rule L, LR-024): no live master + **0 data holders** → seed `redis-0`; **≥1 holders, one lineage** (`holdersDiverged` union-find over `{master_replid, master_replid2}`) → promote `BestDataHolder`, **no opt-in** (a post-failover promotion chain is one lineage — LR-024 lesson); **≥2 lineages** → refuse (`FailoverRecovery` condition, `RefusedDataPresent` event) unless `failover.allowUnsafeRebootstrapOnDeadlock`. Execution order: stamp the new intent (epoch bump) → `REPLICAOF NO ONE` → **fence the outgoing master** → label flip → repoint stragglers; every step idempotent and **resumable from live state** (a half-applied promotion is re-derived and re-issued, no persisted cursor).
- **Promotion alone is not a handover — the outgoing master is fenced** (LR-038, pure `planFailoverFence`): promoting a replica says who the *new* master is and nothing about the old one, which on a graceful delete is still alive and still mastering for the rest of its ~10s preStop window. The operator never spoke to it (the straggler repoint that would is blocked by its own `!anyTerminating` gate) and an established client connection through the master Service is **not** re-routed by the label flip, so the client kept writing into a doomed pod for the whole grace window — *however fast the operator promoted* — and those writes died with it. **Measured: 202 of 1171 acknowledged writes lost, with `DataCorruptions: 0` and write availability 97.66%** — the keys were gone, not wrong, so nothing caught it. The fix demotes the outgoing master (`REPLICAOF <new-master>`) so it answers `-READONLY`: **visible write failures instead of silent data loss**, pillar 3.2's principle applied to failover rather than to memory pressure. Not a new mechanism — it is the straggler repoint applied to the one pod that gate excludes, at the one moment it matters, hence best-effort and idempotent; skipped when the outgoing master is unreachable (the crash path), already demoted, or is itself the pod being promoted. Corollary for the graduation gate: **an availability bar is blind to this class**, so the gate now carries a durability bound measured by an exact sweep over every acknowledged write, not by sampled read counters (one lost key read five times is not five lost keys). Sentinel mode never had the hole — its pod-led preStop waits for the master address to change, converting handover into *visible* write failures — yet failover mode still *beat* it on write availability in both variants, which is precisely why the numbers misled.
- **Guards, redefined** (no Rule A): a promotion is **never blocked by the dead master's own termination** — `failoverPromotionUnsettled` blocks a NEW mastership decision only while the intended master is still *alive and converging*; a dead/unreachable target never blocks its own replacement (gating on bare unsettledness would deadlock exactly the crash recovery this mode exists for). Cascades serialize via a 10s post-transition cooldown keyed on `transitionSince`. Secondary healing keeps the conservative gate: straggler repoint (Rule R reused) requires a settled transition and no terminating pods; re-authorization of parked/fresh pods requires a settled transition (annotation stamps are inert metadata). Probes make no topology decisions (LR-016) — the failover probes *delegate to the sentinel builders* (local-PING liveness, `link:up` readiness) so the modes cannot drift (§7 parity).
- **Watcher accelerates, reconcile decides**: a per-instance background goroutine (`failover_monitor.go`, the `+switch-master` subscriber's replacement as the fast path) INFO-probes `status.master.ip` on a ~1s cadence and pushes one `GenericEvent` per failure streak crossing `downAfterMilliseconds` — it only makes a reconcile look sooner, never declares death itself.
- **Verification status**: unit/envtest green; **e2e-verified 16/16 on a real 3-node cluster (scm-s2, 2026-08-01)** — functional, graceful/crash failover (UID+RunID+label-agreement asserted), event path 4.96s (<15s bar), polling-only tier, the **hybrid double-failover graduation scenario** (promotion chain redis-0→1→2, the LR-007/LR-008/LR-024 class does not reproduce), kill-9 epoch-yield park (chaos: corruptions 0, write availability 96.5%), all three deadlock tiers (multi-holder same-lineage promotes with **no refuse** — the deliberate contrast to Rule L), rolling update with data intact. The ADR-011 **graduation gate remainder**: chaos/soak run + managed-cloud dogfooding evidence, then the drop/coexist/replace-sentinel decision.

## 4. Deployment Modes

| Mode | Architecture | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standalone** | 1 Redis Pod | Dev / Simple caching |
| **Sentinel** | 3 Redis (1M+2R) + 3 Sentinels | High Availability (HA) |
| **Failover** | `1 + replicas` Redis pods (default 1M+2R), **no Sentinels** — *experimental* | HA without Sentinel processes (operator-led, ADR-011) |
| **Cluster** | `shards × (1 + replicasPerShard)` Pods, as **one StatefulSet per shard** (`{name}-shard-K`) | Horizontal Scaling / Large Data |

### Key Logic:
- **Sentinel Mode**: The operator manages a `redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/role: master` label on Pods. The `{name}` Service uses this label as a selector to always route traffic to the current master.
- **Failover Mode** (experimental): same label routing as sentinel mode (`{name}` Service → `role: master`), but the operator itself is the failure detector and failover decider. Roles are assigned by stamping `assigned-role` / `assigned-master-ip` / `assignment-epoch` annotations on the data pods, read back through a downward-API volume; a background master watcher accelerates detection. See pillar 3.14 and ADR-011.
- **Cluster Mode**: N per-shard StatefulSets (`{name}-shard-K`, pod `-K-0` = shard K master; stable `redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/shard` label — pillar 3.12), fronted by one shared headless Service `{name}-cluster`. Sophisticated repair loop handles:
    1. Quorum loss (via `CLUSTER FAILOVER TAKEOVER`).
    2. Partition healing (via `CLUSTER MEET`).
    3. Ghost node removal (via `CLUSTER FORGET`).
    4. Slot reassignment and replica management.

## 7. Critical Development Rules

1. **Idempotency**: Reconciliation must be idempotent. Always re-fetch the latest object state before updates to avoid conflicts.
2. **Scaffold Markers**: Never remove `// +kubebuilder:scaffold:*` markers.
3. **Auto-Generated Files**: Do not manually edit files marked `DO NOT EDIT` (e.g., `zz_generated.*`, `config/crd/bases/*`). Run `make manifests generate` instead.
4. **Owner References**: Use `SetControllerReference` so K8s garbage collects child resources when the `LittleRed` CR is deleted.
5. **Testing**: Add unit tests in `internal/controller/` and E2E tests in `test/e2e/` for any new feature or bug fix.
6. **Documentation Maintenance**: After any non-trivial change to the data model (API/Status), operator logic, or architectural decisions, you **MUST** update all relevant documentation files (e.g., `docs/API_SPEC.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, etc.).
7. **Debugging — get ground truth via `lrctl`**: When investigating an e2e failure, a stuck reconciliation, a suspected split-brain / ghost master / ghost node, a wrong master label, or any "what is the actual topology right now" question, use the `lrctl` CLI (`status` / `verify` / `inspect` / `debug-dump`, all read-only) instead of hand-rolling `kubectl exec ... redis-cli` loops. `verify` is the workhorse: it gathers operator-side ground truth, computes the authority master, and flags ghosts/partitions. The `lrctl-debug` skill carries the symptom→verb playbook and output-reading guide.
8. **Lint before pushing**: Always run `make lint` (and `make test`) before pushing. Do not push a branch that has unresolved lint issues — CI enforces the same `golangci-lint` config, so a dirty branch will fail there anyway. Fix lint locally first.
9. **Licensing**: The project is Apache-2.0 (`LICENSE`). Every Go source file carries the standard header `Copyright <year> The littlered Authors.` from `hack/boilerplate.go.txt` — do not attribute copyright to any individual or company. Third-party attributions live in `NOTICE`; the full dependency-license inventory is generated (`make licenses`) into `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES`. Regenerate it whenever dependencies change. See `AUTHORS` for maintainers.

10. **Cross-mode parity — fix the sibling, don't wait to be bitten**: The modes (standalone, sentinel, cluster) share the same underlying concerns — gather/probe fan-out, dial timeouts and retries, ghost/stale-IP handling, status computation — implemented in *parallel* code paths. A bug in one of these is almost always latent in the others. When you identify and fix such a bug in one mode, **immediately audit the other modes for the same pattern and fix them in the same change**. Do not ship a fix for cluster (or sentinel) alone and leave the twin defect waiting. Example: LR-012 made the *cluster* gather (`gatherNodeIdentities`) concurrent but left the *sentinel* gather (`GatherClusterState`, since renamed `GatherReplicationState`) sequential — the identical blackhole-dial stall then resurfaced in sentinel mode on a managed cloud.

### Test Discipline (test-first, red-first)

Test-first, red-first. The prior habit — authoring tests in the same pass as the
implementation — produces tests that only mirror the code's assumptions (bugs included):
they pass, but were never shown to catch anything.

**The rule:** every test must be observed to FAIL, for the right reason, at least once
before it counts as coverage. A test that never went red is a mirror, not a check. Author
the check *before* the implementation and show the failing run first; then make it pass.
This matters most under agentic coding — an agent testing its own just-written code tends to
codify its own mistakes and report green, so the red is the only thing that proves the test
has teeth.

Applied per tier:

1. **Bugs → failing repro first.** Write the reproduction as a committed test, watch it go
   red *for the defect's actual reason*, then fix to green. For a latency/liveness bug (e.g.
   a reconcile that stalls on dead-IP dials) the red is an observed stall or a broken
   invariant — not a downstream symptom that could go green again by timing luck.
2. **New pure/unit-testable logic → assertion first.** Write the assertion straight from the
   ADR/spec, see it fail, implement to green. Fast red-green lives here. Most sentinel/cluster
   healing decisions already have a pure seam for exactly this — `planLeaderlessRecovery`,
   `DetermineRealMaster`, `BestDataHolder`, and the injectable `Gatherer` interface behind
   `GatherReplicationState` / `GatherClusterGroundTruth`.
3. **e2e-only behavior (reconcile/replication) → target assertion first.** Adjust the e2e to
   the intended behavior, confirm it is red against current code, then implement (slow loop
   accepted). Design corollary: push the *decision* into a thin pure function (as above) so it
   is unit-TDD-able fast, leaving e2e a thin integration shell. When the red is only reachable
   on a specific environment (e.g. a cloud whose dead pod IPs blackhole rather than RST),
   observing it there once satisfies the tier — but make the *repeatable* guard a tier-2 unit
   test, since the e2e will not go red in CI.

**Not dogmatic:** behavior-preserving refactors under already-green tests need no new red —
the existing tests are the guard. Red-first applies to new behavior and bug fixes. If a test
will not go red for the intended reason, treat it as a broken test and say so — do not paper
over it.

## 9. Key Resolved Investigations

### Sentinel Ghost Master Split-Brain (2026-02-20, LR-007/LR-008)
**Test:** `Sentinel Advanced Failover Hybrid (Production) Mode > should recover correctly with both mechanisms active (crash)`

**Root cause:** The hybrid test runs a graceful failover immediately followed by a crash failover on the same cluster. Two sentinels race to lead the second failover; one is superseded before it records `+switch-master` and is left permanently monitoring the ghost master IP — stuck at `s_down`, unable to reach `o_down` alone (quorum = 2). Classic non-self-healing split-brain caused entirely within Sentinel's election mechanism.

**Fix (LR-008):** Ghost master correction via `SENTINEL REMOVE` + `SENTINEL MONITOR <consensus-master-IP>`. A prior attempt with targeted `SENTINEL RESET` (LR-007) was found ineffective — RESET does not change the monitored master IP. The REMOVE+MONITOR sequence forces the stuck sentinel to immediately point at the correct living master. See `docs/RECONCILIATION_ALGORITHM_CHANGELOG.md` (LR-007, LR-008) and ADR-003.

### Leaderless Sentinel Bootstrap Deadlock (2026-07-09, LR-015)
**Symptom:** Two sentinel instances stuck not-serving for ~50 min after a mass pod restart. All Sentinels bare (monitoring nothing), all Redis pods `1/2 Running` (`redis-server` in the startup wait-loop). `RealMasterIP == ""`, so every consensus-master-gated healing rule short-circuited. Manual `SENTINEL MONITOR` on one sentinel (or a CR delete+redeploy) was required to recover.

**Root cause:** No re-bootstrap path for an already-initialized instance. `bootstrapRequired` is set once at `Phase == ""` and never re-armed; Rule 0 / LR-008 / LR-013 all require `RealMasterIP != ""`. So when the whole Sentinel quorum loses its config there is no rule that fires.

**Fix (LR-015):** Rule L (`recoverLeaderlessDeadlock`) — see pillar 3.10 and ADR-005. Data-aware: safe no-data reseed of `redis-0` by default; destructive rebootstrap-over-data only with `sentinel.allowUnsafeRebootstrapOnDeadlock`.

### Sentinel Liveness Probe Wiped Survivors During Leaderless Recovery (2026-07-12, LR-016)
**Symptom:** The Rule L e2e multi-holder tier failed — the operator `Reseeded` (saw 0 data holders) where it should have hit `RefusedDataPresent` (≥2 holders, opt-in off). Debug artifacts: both surviving replicas got `Container redis failed liveness probe, will be restarted` ~24s after their master died, restarted empty into the wait-loop, so the operator genuinely saw 0 holders.

**Root cause:** The sentinel liveness probe (ADR-003 2026-02-19 amendment) restarted any replica whose master was unreachable and not `role:master`/`link:up`, to self-heal "zombie" replicas following a ghost. But it cannot distinguish a zombie (a real master exists elsewhere) from a leaderless survivor (no master exists) — both are locally `role:slave` + `link:down` + master-unreachable — and in the leaderless case the restart wipes the survivor's data (EmptyDir), destroying what Rule L is meant to preserve.

**Fix (LR-016):** Reduced the sentinel liveness probe to a plain local health check (bootstrap guard + `PING`), matching standalone/cluster. Topology repair is operator-owned: Rule R (LR-009) redirects zombies via `SLAVEOF` without a restart; Rule L (LR-015) preserves/promotes leaderless survivors. Readiness (still `link:up`-gated) keeps a masterless replica out of traffic. See pillar 3.10 and the ADR-003 supersession note.

### Sentinel Reconcile Stalled ~146s on Blackholing Dead Pod IPs (2026-07-28, LR-017)
**Symptom:** On a managed cloud, the single-survivor leaderless-recovery e2e failed as "data lost" — `status.master.podName` stayed `redis-0` (the killed master, restarted empty). Rule L itself is correct (the local control run promoted the survivor); the operator simply never got to run it in time. Operator logs show one reconcile blocked **~146s** (the whole recovery window) dialing the killed Sentinels' stale IPs, which **blackholed** (`i/o timeout` / `no route to host`) one after another. Did **not** reproduce on local kubeadm, where killed IPs RST fast (`connection refused`) and the same paths return in ~2s.

**Root cause:** Missing per-probe deadline in two sentinel-mode paths that cluster mode already bounds (LR-012). (1) `GatherClusterState` (since renamed `GatherReplicationState`) probed every Redis/Sentinel pod **sequentially** (cluster's `gatherNodeIdentities` was made concurrent in LR-012; the sentinel loop never was). (2) The status/master-resolution path (`getMasterPodName` → `SentinelClient.GetMaster`/`GetMasterState`) loops `c.addresses` sequentially with `DefaultTimeout` (5s) + go-redis retries and **no per-address context deadline**. Informer-cache lag keeps killed sentinels listed `Ready`, so their stale IPs enter the list; each blackholing address burns ~`5s × retries`. The stall froze status at its stale bootstrap value and starved Rule L.

**Fix (LR-017):** Made `GatherClusterState` probe concurrently; renamed `ClusterProbeTimeout` → mode-neutral `ProbeTimeout` (3s) and wrapped the gatherer's `GetRedisState` and every `SentinelClient` read-path address loop in `context.WithTimeout(ctx, ProbeTimeout)`, so a dead address fails in ≤3s regardless of retries. The sentinel-mode completion of LR-012; the worked example for the cross-mode-parity rule (§7). See changelog LR-017.

**Verified on the managed cloud** (the environment that produced the 146s red): no-data + single-survivor tiers pass, probe timeout fires (`context deadline exceeded`) instead of hanging, recovery ~7s with no stall. The multi-holder e2e tier was separately flaky (a graceful master delete let the operator re-register returning bare Sentinels onto the still-`Terminating` master → ordinary data-safe failover, so it never even reached leaderless detection). Hardened that tier to force-delete, which reliably drives leaderless *detection* — but not the REFUSE *decision*: the operator's re-registration (Rule 0 / LR-008) can still recover the cluster during Rule L's 30s cooldown (also data-safe; this is what the verification run did). So the tier accepts either data-safe outcome and **always** asserts no data loss — a false negative must never become a false positive. The REFUSE gate itself stays guarded by `planLeaderlessRecovery` unit tests; e2e exercises it opportunistically, not deterministically.

### Cluster Consolidated-Shard Deadlock — Reshard Recovery (2026-07-29, LR-018)
**Symptom:** A field report (`debug-0720`, Redis 8.4.2 cluster, `shards:3`/`replicasPerShard:1`) stuck in `phase: Initializing` ~19h. Redis healthy (`cluster_state:ok`, 16384 slots) but one master owned two shard ranges (`0-5461`+`10923-16383`) while two pods were slotless empty masters — `CountMasters()==2 != shards`, `cluster_size:2`. Every ~2s reconcile logged "running repair" then did nothing.

**Root cause:** No repair branch could act. Step 3 (missing shards) checks each range has *an* owner, never a *distinct* one, so the double-ownership was invisible; Step 4 (empty-master reattach) only targets under-replicated slot-masters, and both slot-masters were already fully replicated. `IsHealthy` failed forever with no actionable step. The operator had no reshard/slot-migration capability. The state was most likely created by Step 3 itself: an EmptyDir mass-restart orphaned a range, and Step 3's stale pod-index→shard assumption re-added it to a pod already owning another range.

**Fix (LR-018):** Step 3b `reshardConsolidated` — detect via pure `PlanReshard`, relocate the surplus range onto an empty master **preserving keys** (no drop-keys opt-in; a non-lossy reshard always exists — contrast ADR-005). Mechanism by free gather-time capability probe: Redis 8.4+ native atomic slot migration (`CLUSTER MIGRATION IMPORT`), else the incremental key-preserving `reshardViaDance` (resumes from on-node IMPORTING/MIGRATING markers, key-count budget per reconcile). Cause closed in Step 3 via `SafeMissingShardTarget`. Exposed and fixed a latent `ParseClusterNodes` bug (migrating/importing `[...]` notations were parsed as owned slots). See ADR-006, pillar 3.11, changelog LR-018.

**Validated e2e on the lab:** ASM path on Redis 8.4.2 (300/300 keys, `cluster_size:3`); dance on Redis 7.4.0 (5000-key range drained in 3 passes, resumed from markers, 5000/5000 keys, no leftover markers). The parser bug was caught by the 7.4 e2e via `lrctl verify` — a mid-migration-topology defect unreachable by unit tests. Deferred sibling: LR-019 (replica rebalance).

### Cluster Per-Shard StatefulSets — Direction A complete (2026-07-30, LR-020/021/022)
**What:** cluster mode moved from one `{name}-cluster` StatefulSet (striped pod-index→shard) to **one StatefulSet per shard** `{name}-shard-K` with a stable `redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/shard` label, so single-failure-domain survivability (a shard's master + replica never share a node/zone) becomes expressible. See pillar 3.12, ADR-007. **Breaking (0.3.0)**: clean-slate cluster migration (EmptyDir); operator refuses to run beside a legacy single STS (`LegacyClusterTopology`) rather than delete data.

**Why *mandatory*, not cosmetic** (the load-bearing argument, in ADR-007 verbatim): a `topologySpreadConstraint` needs a stable, schedule-time, per-shard key; a single StatefulSet has one `spec.template` so every pod is stamped identically and K8s injects only ordinal/revision labels — **one template ⇒ no schedule-time shard key ⇒ only a bespoke mutating webhook could fake it.** Per-shard STSs express it declaratively.

**The "A is not free" finding (first e2e run):** the operator's own Step 4 empty-master reattach was shard-blind (`for _, m := range gt.Nodes`, random map order) and welded every replica to a *different* shard's master **at bootstrap** — decoupling Redis shards from shard STSs. Root cause is structural: **OSS Redis/Valkey Cluster has no failure-domain awareness** (rack-zone = Redis Enterprise only; Valkey AZ = client read routing), and both the reattach *and* Redis's autonomous replica migration re-pair across shards. Fixes: shard-aware `chooseReattachTarget` (red-first) + `cluster-allow-replica-migration no`. The operator is the sole topology authority.

**Three landed pieces:**
- **LR-020** — the split + shard-aware reattach + migration-off + colocation guards (`CheckShardColocation`; `lrctl verify` FAILs on cross-STS pairing + `[DEGRADED]` on `link:down`; e2e asserts colocation).
- **LR-021** — serialized rolling updates: `reconcileClusterStatefulSet` applies template *updates* one shard at a time (create-missing stays parallel), gating on `clusterShardRolloutSettled` (`ObservedGeneration==Generation` closes the cache-lag race), change detected via `AnnotationPodSpecHash`. The split had silently dropped the single STS's global one-pod-at-a-time serialization → parallel roll restarted all masters at once (availability dip, `corruptions:0`). Governs operator-triggered rollouts only.
- **LR-022** — `spec.placement.shardAntiAffinity {topologyKey, whenUnsatisfiable}` → per-shard `topologySpreadConstraint` (`maxSkew:1`, shard-label selector) injected per shard STS, appended to `spec.podTemplate` constraints. Defaults hostname + `ScheduleAnyway` (soft; CNPG/Strimzi convention). Cluster-only.

**Validated:** full e2e suite 82/82 (all modes + extended) green after LR-020/021; the LR-022 placement e2e proved same-shard pods land on **distinct nodes** on a real 3-node cluster (hard `DoNotSchedule`). **Deferred/tracked:** under-provisioning status condition (+cluster-wide `nodes` RBAC). **Direction B (topology-aware master balancing) is declined — see ADR-009** (a challenge surface documenting why: replica-routed reads already spread load, `replicasPerShard:1` has no balancing freedom, no schedule-time master label, active balancing only adds failover churn). Work lives on `feat/per-shard-statefulsets`, merged to `e2e-0730`; `release/0.3.0` to be populated after review.

### Cluster Total-/Partial-Wipe Re-Bootstrap (2026-07-31, LR-023)
**Symptom:** the cluster analog of the sentinel leaderless deadlock (LR-015), found by building the reproduction e2e. A **pod-delete** wipe (node recycle) self-heals through the normal repair loop (verified green). A **mass container-crash** (kill-9 of every pod) does not: `nodes.conf` survives on the EmptyDir, every restarted master parks in the startup STEP-3 yield loop (LR-003) with no live replica to `TAKEOVER`, → `CrashLoopBackOff`, never Ready → the operator (gated on `allPodsReady`) never gathers. Reproduced on Kind: 5/6 pods `CrashLoopBackOff`, one escaped replica as an empty master, `cluster_state:fail`, 0/16384 slots, no recovery.

**Root cause:** no operator path breaks a deadlock where the pods are stuck *not-Ready* — repair only runs after `allPodsReady` — and the startup script cannot self-decide to abandon data (from one parked pod it can't tell a total wipe from a temporarily-unreachable live replica; the STEP-3 park branch is not a clean "no live replica" dichotomy).

**Fix (LR-023):** operator-owned recycle — `recoverClusterWipeDeadlock` (pure `planClusterWipeRecovery`, red-first table) deletes exactly the stuck pods (redis **not-Ready + crash-looping + not OOMKilled**) after a 120s `status.cluster.wipeDeadlockSince` cooldown; StatefulSets reschedule them fresh and the pod-delete self-heal path re-bootstraps. Data safety rests on the **kubelet readiness probe** (blackhole-proof, unlike the operator's remote dial — LR-017): a not-Ready redis in a pure in-memory cluster holds no data, so deleting it loses nothing; a **Ready** data holder is never recycled (partial-wipe survivor preserved, promoted by Step 0/1). Startup script unchanged. RBAC gains `delete` on `pods`. See pillar 3.13, ADR-008. **e2e-verified 3/3 on a real 3-node cluster (scm-s2, 2026-07-31):** Flavor A self-heal (~60s), Flavor B recycle-recover (~2.5min = 120s cooldown + reschedule), partial-wipe survivor data intact (the Step 0/1 promotion beat any slot-assign race — no repair-ordering fix needed).

### Ghost-Master Sentinel Failover Deadlock — Operator-Led Recovery (2026-07-31, LR-024)
**Symptom:** the long-green e2e `Sentinel Failover > should elect new master after master pod deletion (crash)` (SEN-011) deadlocked on a real multi-node cluster (scm-s2; not on isolated Kind — timing/env-sensitive, cf. LR-017). The `Ordered` context runs `(graceful)` then `(crash)` on one shared instance; `lrctl verify` showed all Sentinels monitoring a ghost master IP and every Redis pod `role:slave` following it `link:down` — `Authority Master: NONE`, CR `master: {}` for the full 90s. Data safe (survivors keep their keys).

**Root cause:** the graceful failover leaves the old master IP as a ghost replica; the operator's Rule D ghost-replica `SENTINEL RESET` fires ~4s later — *correctly* permitted, because between the two failovers the cluster is legitimately whole, so LR-013's wholeness gate passes — emptying Sentinel's replica list; the crash then kills the current master before Sentinel re-learns the replicas from its `INFO` → `no-good-slave` forever. The operator falls in the gap between LR-008 (needs a living consensus master) and Rule L (needs *bare* Sentinels). Source-confirmed (Redis + Valkey `sentinel.c`): no surgical single-replica prune exists and a dead replica never ages out — the permanent deadlock is self-inflicted by the RESET. Not a fresh regression (Rule D ships in v0.2.1; a second ordering LR-013 did not cover).

**Fix (LR-024, recovery half):** `recoverGhostMasterDeadlock` (pure `planGhostMasterRecovery`, sibling of Rule L) — see pillar 3.10 "Ghost-master variant". The safety gate is replication **lineage** (`holdersDiverged`), not holder count. A first e2e run refused because a normal post-failover **promotion chain** (`master_replid` rotates, old → `master_replid2`) looked divergent; fixed by gathering `master_replid2` and computing divergence via union-find over `{replid, replid2}` (lesson: never key lineage on `master_replid` alone). Prevention (retiring the ghost-replica RESET / Rule D) is deferred for review — `docs/GHOST_MASTER_FAILOVER_DEADLOCK_DESIGN.md`, prospective ADR-010. Recovery unit/envtest green; e2e green re-verification pending on `e2e-0731` @ 38e9df2.

### Legacy→Per-Shard Migration Restart Deadlock — Replicate-then-Failover Redesign (2026-08-09, LR-025)
**Symptom:** the ADR-013 in-place legacy→per-shard migration deadlocked and lost data on s1 (dance path, redis 7.4.0, WS2b run). Mid-migration a new per-shard master `{name}-shard-0-0` went `CrashLoopBackOff`; `CLUSTER NODES` showed it `master,fail,disconnected` owning a partial range (`0-285`) while the legacy master owned the remainder, `cluster_state:fail`. The migrated keys for the drained slots were gone.

**Root cause (design gap, not a bug):** the original mechanism drained slots node-to-node (native ASM / MIGRATE dance) from a `Draining` phase and attached the new replicas *afterward* (`ReplicasAttached`). So during `Draining` each new master owns slots on EmptyDir (pillar 3.1) **with no replica yet** — a single point of failure for the whole drain window. A restart there trips the startup STEP-3 guard (LR-003): the node still owns slots, has no replica to `TAKEOVER`, parks → `CrashLoopBackOff`; and the just-migrated keys, already `MIGRATE`-deleted from the source, lived only in that master's RAM → lost. Latent in the ASM path too (its ~8s atomic window merely made a restart unlikely).

**Fix (LR-025):** redesign the mechanism to **replicate-then-failover** — migration no longer moves slots. Each new pod joins as a slot-less replica of the legacy master owning its range, full-syncs, then `{name}-shard-K-0` is promoted by a coordinated `CLUSTER FAILOVER` (atomic ownership flip; the legacy master demotes to a live replica). New nodes reach the slot-owning state only after an already-redundant handoff, so the unsafe "owns slots, no synced replica" state never exists — restart-safe for **all** `replicasPerShard` incl. 0 (the demoted legacy master is the transient replica until decommission), and the **startup script is unchanged** (STEP-3's `TAKEOVER` breaker always has a replica). Phases: `Standup → Meet → Replicate → Failover → Decommission → Complete`. Chosen over a minimal "attach a replica before draining" patch (fixes only rps≥1, still transits the unsafe state); the full-sync fork is ordinary replica-resync load sizing already tolerates. The LR-018 reshard executor stays in the tree but migration no longer calls it. Two pure-seam invariants carry it red-first (Failover only on a link-`up`-synced K-0; legacy `FORGET` only at full new-side redundancy — the strict phase precedence *is* the redundancy gate). **Live-verified on s1 at 7.4.0** (the deadlock environment) + 8.4.2: default + hold + a restart-during-migration chaos tier (crash a `{name}-shard-K-0` container both pre- and post-failover → no deadlock, no data loss, reaches `Complete`) all green; the M1 pure seam handled the exact old-bug scenario on first real contact with no code fix. See ADR-013, `docs/LEGACY_CLUSTER_MIGRATION_DESIGN.md` §10, and changelog LR-025.

**Follow-up — chaos "Can't replicate myself" self-replicate deadlock (2026-08-10, scm-s2):** a *second*, distinct chaos failure mode of the redesign. Crash (B) crashed the intended new master `{name}-shard-0-0` while it owned its range; Redis natively failed the range over to the new *replica* pod `{name}-shard-0-1`, which now owned it. The Replicate planner then computed that pod's range owner as **itself** and emitted `CLUSTER REPLICATE <self>` (`ERR Can't replicate myself`) forever — CR stuck at `Replicate (2/3)` 14m+. No data loss (all slots served). Fix: generalize the planner's "already owns its range ⇒ settled, not a replicate target" exemption from *just* `{name}-shard-K-0` to **any** new pod (`nodeOwnsRange`), so `REPLICATE <self>` is never emitted and the `Failover` phase reconciles which K-0 is master; belt-and-suspenders self-skip in the driver. Red-first unit guards: `TestPlanReplicateNeverTargetsSelf` + a "replicate CHAOS" table case. Env-sensitive (reproduced on scm-s2, not s1); the e2e chaos tier's `waitMigrationComplete` is the opportunistic integration guard. See changelog LR-025 addendum.

# LittleRed - LLM Startup Guide

Welcome! This document provides a high-level, condensed overview of the LittleRed project to help you get up to speed quickly and contribute effectively.

---

## 1. Project Essence
**LittleRed** is a lightweight Kubernetes operator for deploying and managing **Redis/Valkey** as a high-performance, pure in-memory store. It is built using the **Kubebuilder** framework.

### Core Philosophy
- **Pure In-Memory**: Designed for speed and simplicity. No persistence (RDB/AOF) is ever enabled by default, not even "by accident" for internal metadata.
- **No Eviction by Default**: Follows a strict `noeviction` policy unless the user explicitly configures otherwise. It acts as a reliable in-memory data store that doesn't "forget" data under memory pressure.
- **Cloud Native**: Leverages Kubernetes primitives (StatefulSets, Services) while handling Redis-specific cluster logic in the operator.

---

## 2. Terminology

"Cluster" is overloaded in the Redis world. Always use these terms to avoid ambiguity:

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **instance** | Any LittleRed-managed Redis deployment, regardless of mode |
| **standalone** | A single Redis pod (`mode: standalone`) |
| **sentinel** | The HA mode: 3 Redis pods (1 master + 2 replicas) monitored by 3 sentinel processes (`mode: sentinel`) |
| **sentinels** | The 3 monitoring processes within a sentinel instance specifically |
| **Redis Cluster** | The gossip-based sharding mode (`mode: cluster`) |

**Rules:**
- "Cluster" on its own always means Redis Cluster mode — never use it as a generic synonym for "a Redis deployment."
- "Instance" is the generic term for any LittleRed deployment.
- Do not say "sentinel cluster" — it's ambiguous (could mean the whole sentinel setup, or the sentinel processes themselves).
- Do not call LittleRed "optimized for caching" — the default policy is `noeviction`, not LRU/LFU. It is a general-purpose in-memory store.

## 3. Architectural Pillars

### 3.1 Strictly No Persistence
- **Decision**: Persistence (RDB/AOF) is **actively disabled** across all components.
- **Rationale**: Eliminates dependencies on PersistentVolumes (PVCs), simplifies disaster recovery, and ensures predictable performance.
- **Implication**: Pod restarts result in a clean slate. Data durability is achieved via replication (Sentinel/Cluster modes) across live nodes, never via disk.

### 3.2 Default 'noeviction' Policy
- **Decision**: The default `maxmemory-policy` is `noeviction`.
- **Rationale**: Provides an "honest" data store behavior where memory exhaustion results in errors rather than silent data loss (eviction).
- **Instruction**: Avoid calling the project "optimized for caching" to prevent users from assuming a default LRU/LFU policy. It is a general-purpose in-memory store.

### 3.3 Resource Defaults
- **Decision**: Memory `limits` equal `requests` by default (preventing OOM surprises). No CPU limit by default. Set the CPU *request* to match the instance's thread budget; users can add an explicit CPU limit for Guaranteed QoS if their platform requires it.
- **Rationale**: Redis's CPU consumption is **bounded by its thread count**, not unbounded — command execution runs on a single main thread, plus a configurable set of `io-threads` for socket reads/writes and protocol parsing (the `io-threads` count *includes* the main thread; since Redis 6.0 it offloads I/O, and Redis 8 always threads both reads and writes when `io-threads > 1` — `io-threads-do-reads` is obsolete there — but command execution stays single-threaded). Because Redis can't exceed its thread budget, a CPU *limit* has no upside: it can only throttle Redis under load, which turns into rising latency, request pile-up, and cascading timeouts in dependent services. Size the CPU *request* to the thread budget instead. Memory must still be bounded to protect the node.

### 3.4 Kubernetes as "Source of Truth"
- **Decision**: For Cluster mode, the operator uses the Kubernetes Pod list to detect "ghost" nodes.
- **Rationale**: Redis gossip can lag (up to 15s+). Knowing a Pod is gone via the K8s API allows immediate `CLUSTER FORGET` and faster healing.

### 3.5 Minimal Interference (Enablement over Intervention)
- **Philosophy**: Trust and enable Redis's internal mechanisms (Gossip, Sentinel) to handle their own state transitions. Don't "work against" them or attempt to "accelerate" their built-in timers (like `cluster-node-timeout`) unless absolutely necessary.
- **When to Intervene**:
    1. **Loss of Quorum**: When Redis cannot self-heal because it lacks a majority (e.g., `CLUSTER FAILOVER TAKEOVER`).
    2. **Deadlocks**: When a specific failure sequence prevents auto-recovery (e.g., a master failing before a replica has fully synced).
    3. **External Knowledge**: When the operator knows something Redis doesn't (e.g., "The Pod for this NodeID is deleted from K8s, it's never coming back").
- **Key Goal**: Support the internal workings of Sentinel and Gossip, only "helping" when a permanent stall or cluster-wide failure is detected.

### 3.6 Safe Bootstrap (Sentinel Mode)
- **Decision**: Uses `status.bootstrapRequired` and Operator-led registration in Sentinel.
- **Rationale**: Prevents empty restarted masters from wiping data on live replicas via full sync by strictly authorizing mastership via Sentinel.
- **Instruction**: All Redis pods must start in a wait-loop querying Sentinel until a master is assigned by the Operator.

### 3.7 Strict IP-Only Identity (Sentinel Mode)
- **Decision**: Sentinel and Redis nodes strictly use **Pod IPs** for identification, with hostname announcement and resolution explicitly disabled.
- **Rationale**: In a pure in-memory architecture, a pod restart results in total data loss. By using ephemeral IPs, a restarted pod (with a new IP) is treated as a completely new node by Sentinel. This prevents "Ghost Masters" (empty pods reclaimed as masters) and eliminates DNS-related race conditions during failover.
- **Implication**: Any transition to persistent storage (PVCs) will require a pivot to stable Podname-based identities. (See ADR-001)

### 3.8 Discovery Deadlock Prevention (Sentinel Mode)
- **Decision**: Removed `PING` connectivity check from the Redis startup script. (See ADR-002)
- **Rationale**: Replicas must start `redis-server` even if the reported master is unreachable. This allows them to register with Sentinel as living replicas, enabling Sentinel to perform a failover when the master is dead. Keeping the `PING` check leads to a deadlock where no replicas ever start because they are waiting for a master that Sentinel hasn't promoted yet.
- **Assumed Risk**: We assume Redis/Valkey handles unreachable masters gracefully at startup via standard retry logic.

### 3.9 Ghost Node Healing (Sentinel Mode)
- **Decision**: Proactively correct dead IPs from Sentinel's topology; strategy differs for ghost replicas vs ghost masters.
- **Ghost replicas**: When dead pod IPs appear in Sentinel's *replica* list, issue `SENTINEL RESET` (broadcast to all sentinels). This clears the stale entries without directing Sentinel to any specific master. Only applied after Rule A passes (no terminating pods, no active failover) and the consensus master is a verified living pod.
- **Ghost master** (LR-008): A dual-failover race can leave a sentinel permanently stuck monitoring a ghost master IP — it cannot reach `o_down` alone and cannot self-correct. `SENTINEL RESET` was tried first (LR-007) but found ineffective: RESET clears replica/sentinel lists but does **not** change the monitored master IP; the sentinel reconnects to the same ghost. The correct fix (LR-008) is `SENTINEL REMOVE` followed by `SENTINEL MONITOR <consensus-master-IP>` — this forces the sentinel to immediately point at the correct living master. Applied only after Rule A passes. See ADR-003 and `docs/RECONCILIATION_ALGORITHM_CHANGELOG.md` (LR-007, LR-008).

### 3.10 Leaderless Bootstrap-Deadlock Recovery (Sentinel Mode)
- **Decision**: The operator self-heals a *leaderless bootstrap deadlock* — the state where every Sentinel is bare (reachable but monitoring nothing) and no reachable Redis node is a master, so `RealMasterIP == ""` and every consensus-master-gated rule short-circuits. This happens on a mass pod restart of an already-initialized instance, because `bootstrapRequired` is set only once (at `Phase == ""`) and never re-armed. (See ADR-005, changelog LR-015.)
- **Rule L** (`recoverLeaderlessDeadlock`) is the *only* rule that runs while leaderless, and is deliberately conservative: it fires only when all reachable Sentinels are bare (distinguishing a bootstrap deadlock from a recent master death, where Sentinels still monitor the dead master and can fail over), a reachable Sentinel quorum exists, Rule A passes, and the state has persisted past a 30s cooldown (`status.leaderlessSince`).
- **Data safety** (keyed on the count of reachable pods holding keys — `RedisNodeState.Keys`, gathered via full `INFO`): **0 holders** → seed `redis-0`. **Exactly 1 holder** → promote that pod (it's a surviving replica of a dead master; nothing else has data to lose) — safe, no opt-in. **≥2 holders** → electing one discards the others, so **refuse** unless `sentinel.allowUnsafeRebootstrapOnDeadlock` is set, in which case force-elect the most-complete pod (`BestDataHolder`: highest offset, tiebreak keys). Electing a running replica issues `REPLICAOF NO ONE` to promote it (`electMaster`); an unreachable/wait-looping elect starts fresh as master via its startup script.
- **Probes make no topology decisions** (LR-016): the sentinel Redis **liveness** probe is a plain local health check (bootstrap guard + local `PING`), like standalone and cluster mode. It must *not* restart a replica because its master is unreachable — during a leaderless deadlock that would wipe the very survivor data Rule L preserves (storage is EmptyDir). A masterless replica is healthy-and-waiting: **Rule R** (LR-009) redirects it via `SLAVEOF` when a consensus master exists, **Rule L** preserves/promotes it when none does. The **readiness** probe still requires `link:up`, so such a replica is pulled from traffic without being killed.

### 3.11 Consolidated-Shard Reshard Recovery (Cluster Mode)
- **Decision**: The operator self-heals a *consolidated-shard deadlock* — the state where one master owns more than one shard's slot range while other masters sit slotless (empty), so `CountMasters() < shards` yet all slots are assigned. No prior repair step could act (Step 3 only checks each range has *an* owner, not a *distinct* one; Step 4 only reattaches empties to under-replicated slot-masters), so the instance stuck in `Initializing` forever. (See ADR-006, changelog LR-018.)
- **Step 3b** (`reshardConsolidated`, driven by the pure `PlanReshard`): relocate the surplus range off the over-consolidated master onto a reachable empty master, **preserving keys unconditionally**. Distinctness-only destination choice; defers on fragmented ranges / no empty master / healthy. The cause is also closed in Step 3: `SafeMissingShardTarget` restricts missing-shard assignment to a reachable *empty* master, so recovery never piles a second range onto a master that already owns one (the drift that created the state).
- **No drop-keys opt-in** (contrast ADR-005's `allowUnsafeRebootstrapOnDeadlock`): a key-preserving reshard always exists here, so a lossy path is never necessary and none is built.
- **Mechanism by free capability probe**: Redis 8.4+ ⇒ native atomic slot migration (`CLUSTER MIGRATION IMPORT`); pre-8.4 ⇒ the incremental `reshardViaDance` (mark IMPORTING/MIGRATING → drain bounded key batches per reconcile → flip `SETSLOT NODE` only when fully drained, resuming from on-node markers, no persisted state). Support is detected from the `cluster_slot_migration_*` fields in the `CLUSTER INFO` already gathered (AND over reachable nodes) — **nothing is persisted**; a status field is a monitoring surface and an internal capability does not belong there. Tunables `spec.cluster.reshard{KeyBatchSize,MaxKeysPerReconcile,MigrateTimeoutMillis}`.
- **Corollary** (LR-018): the dance is the first path that marks slots IMPORTING/MIGRATING; it exposed a latent `ParseClusterNodes` bug (the `[slot->-id]`/`[slot-<-id]` notations were parsed as owned slots) — now excluded.

### 3.12 Per-Shard StatefulSets & Stable Shard Identity (Cluster Mode)
- **Decision** (0.3.0, breaking): cluster mode is **one StatefulSet per shard** — `{name}-shard-K` (K in `0..shards-1`), each sized `1+replicasPerShard`, stamping a static `redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/shard: "<K>"` identity label. Shard K's master is `{name}-shard-K-0`; `-1..R` are its replicas. This replaces the pre-0.3.0 single `{name}-cluster` STS and its striped pod-index→shard model (pod N = shard N; replicas via `(i-shards)%shards`). The pure `ClusterPodRefs(name, shards, replicasPerShard)` is the single source of truth for pod enumeration + master identity. (See ADR-007, changelog LR-020.)
- **Why mandatory, not cosmetic**: the must-have is single-domain-loss survivability (a shard's master + replica never share a node/zone — durability *is* domain diversity under EmptyDir, pillar 3.1). A `topologySpreadConstraint` needs a *stable, schedule-time, per-shard* selector. A single STS cannot provide one: one `spec.template` ⇒ pods stamped identically; the only per-pod labels K8s injects are ordinal/revision identity (`pod-index`, `pod-name`, `controller-revision-hash`), never shard-semantic; operator-patched labels land after scheduling (`IgnoredDuringExecution`). **One template ⇒ no schedule-time shard key ⇒ only a bespoke mutating webhook could fake it.** Per-shard STSs express it declaratively — and additionally make the shard the *workload unit* (per-shard rolling updates, per-shard PDB) and delete the fragile pod-index→shard decode that caused LR-018.
- **Shared Services stay shard-agnostic**: the one headless Service `{name}-cluster` (selector `component=cluster`) governs every shard STS (`serviceName`), so peer discovery + pod DNS `{pod}.{name}-cluster.ns.svc` resolve across all shards; only shard STS *selectors* carry the shard label. One PDB per shard (`{name}-shard-K-pdb`, redundant shards only).
- **Operator is sole topology authority (A is NOT free — LR-020 e2e finding).** Stable *pod* identity is necessary but insufficient: OSS Redis/Valkey Cluster has **no failure-domain awareness** (Enterprise-only; Valkey AZ = client read routing), and both the operator's Step 4 reattach *and* Redis's autonomous replica migration re-pair a shard's master/replica **across** StatefulSets, topology-blind (observed scrambling the pairing at bootstrap). So per-shard placement holds only because the operator pins each Redis shard inside one STS: **(1) shard-aware reattach** (`chooseReattachTarget` — attach an empty pod to the under-replicated master in *its own* shard) and **(2) `cluster-allow-replica-migration no`** in the cluster config. A thin slice of Direction B that A requires. **Rollout serialization (LR-021):** `reconcileClusterStatefulSet` applies template *updates* one shard at a time (create-missing stays parallel), gating the next shard on the current one settling (`clusterShardRolloutSettled`; change detected via `AnnotationPodSpecHash`). Without it, a config change rolls all shards in parallel and restarts every master in one wave (an availability dip, not data loss — `corruptions:0`). Governs only operator-triggered rollouts; a manual `kubectl rollout restart` bypasses it.
- **Never delete data** (pillar continuity): the split renames workloads (EmptyDir clean slate), so the operator refuses rather than auto-deletes — a lingering legacy `{name}-cluster` STS ⇒ `LegacyClusterTopology` condition + wait; a `shards` decrease ⇒ `ShardScaleDownRefused`. In-place upgrade from pre-0.3.0 is unsupported (documented clean-slate migration).
- **Placement knob (Milestone 2, LR-022)**: `spec.placement.shardAntiAffinity {topologyKey, whenUnsatisfiable}` — the operator injects a **per-shard** `topologySpreadConstraint` (`maxSkew:1`, selector = that shard's pods via the shard label) into each shard STS, appended to any `spec.podTemplate.topologySpreadConstraints` (`buildShardSpreadConstraint`). Defaults `kubernetes.io/hostname` + **`ScheduleAnyway` (soft)** (CNPG/Strimzi convention, pillar 3.5); `DoNotSchedule` is opt-in. This is what actually makes Goal 1 (master/replica never share a domain) usable — the per-shard STS split only made it *expressible*. Cluster-mode only (validation rejects it elsewhere).
- **Scope**: Direction A is complete (Milestone 1 split + Milestone 2 placement knob). Deferred: the under-provisioning status condition (needs cluster-wide `nodes` RBAC) and Direction B (topology-aware master balancing) — see `docs/PER_SHARD_STATEFULSET_DESIGN.md`. Sentinel/standalone need neither (sentinel's single STS already spreads its three data pods).

## 4. Deployment Modes

| Mode | Architecture | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standalone** | 1 Redis Pod | Dev / Simple caching |
| **Sentinel** | 3 Redis (1M+2R) + 3 Sentinels | High Availability (HA) |
| **Cluster** | `shards × (1 + replicasPerShard)` Pods, as **one StatefulSet per shard** (`{name}-shard-K`) | Horizontal Scaling / Large Data |

### Key Logic:
- **Sentinel Mode**: The operator manages a `redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/role: master` label on Pods. The `{name}` Service uses this label as a selector to always route traffic to the current master.
- **Cluster Mode**: N per-shard StatefulSets (`{name}-shard-K`, pod `-K-0` = shard K master; stable `redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/shard` label — pillar 3.12), fronted by one shared headless Service `{name}-cluster`. Sophisticated repair loop handles:
    1. Quorum loss (via `CLUSTER FAILOVER TAKEOVER`).
    2. Partition healing (via `CLUSTER MEET`).
    3. Ghost node removal (via `CLUSTER FORGET`).
    4. Slot reassignment and replica management.

## 5. Tech Stack & Tooling

- **Language**: Go (1.26+)
- **Framework**: Kubebuilder (v4 layout)
- **Testing**: Ginkgo & Gomega (BDD style)
- **Metrics**: `redis_exporter` as a sidecar; optional `ServiceMonitor`.
- **Image**: Defaults to **Redis 8.4.2** (compatible with Redis 7.2+).

## 7. Critical Development Rules

1. **Idempotency**: Reconciliation must be idempotent. Always re-fetch the latest object state before updates to avoid conflicts.
2. **Scaffold Markers**: Never remove `// +kubebuilder:scaffold:*` markers.
3. **Auto-Generated Files**: Do not manually edit files marked `DO NOT EDIT` (e.g., `zz_generated.*`, `config/crd/bases/*`). Run `make manifests generate` instead.
4. **Owner References**: Use `SetControllerReference` so K8s garbage collects child resources when the `LittleRed` CR is deleted.
5. **Testing**: Add unit tests in `internal/controller/` and E2E tests in `test/e2e/` for any new feature or bug fix.
6. **Documentation Maintenance**: After any non-trivial change to the data model (API/Status), operator logic, or architectural decisions, you **MUST** update all relevant documentation files (e.g., `docs/API_SPEC.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, etc.).
7. **Debugging — get ground truth via `lrctl`**: When investigating an e2e failure, a stuck reconciliation, a suspected split-brain / ghost master / ghost node, a wrong master label, or any "what is the actual topology right now" question, use the `lrctl` CLI (`status` / `verify` / `inspect` / `debug-dump`, all read-only) instead of hand-rolling `kubectl exec ... redis-cli` loops. `verify` is the workhorse: it gathers operator-side ground truth, computes the authority master, and flags ghosts/partitions. The `lrctl-debug` skill carries the symptom→verb playbook and output-reading guide.
8. **Lint before pushing**: Always run `make lint` (and `make test`) before pushing. Do not push a branch that has unresolved lint issues — CI enforces the same `golangci-lint` config, so a dirty branch will fail there anyway. Fix lint locally first.
9. **Licensing**: The project is Apache-2.0 (`LICENSE`). Every Go source file carries the standard header `Copyright <year> The littlered Authors.` from `hack/boilerplate.go.txt` — do not attribute copyright to any individual or company. Third-party attributions live in `NOTICE`; the full dependency-license inventory is generated (`make licenses`) into `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES`. Regenerate it whenever dependencies change. See `AUTHORS` for maintainers.

10. **Cross-mode parity — fix the sibling, don't wait to be bitten**: The modes (standalone, sentinel, cluster) share the same underlying concerns — gather/probe fan-out, dial timeouts and retries, ghost/stale-IP handling, status computation — implemented in *parallel* code paths. A bug in one of these is almost always latent in the others. When you identify and fix such a bug in one mode, **immediately audit the other modes for the same pattern and fix them in the same change**. Do not ship a fix for cluster (or sentinel) alone and leave the twin defect waiting. Example: LR-012 made the *cluster* gather (`gatherNodeIdentities`) concurrent but left the *sentinel* gather (`GatherClusterState`) sequential — the identical blackhole-dial stall then resurfaced in sentinel mode on a managed cloud.

### Test Discipline (test-first, red-first)

Test-first, red-first. The prior habit — authoring tests in the same pass as the
implementation — produces tests that only mirror the code's assumptions (bugs included):
they pass, but were never shown to catch anything.

**The rule:** every test must be observed to FAIL, for the right reason, at least once
before it counts as coverage. A test that never went red is a mirror, not a check. Author
the check *before* the implementation and show the failing run first; then make it pass.
This matters most under agentic coding — an agent testing its own just-written code tends to
codify its own mistakes and report green, so the red is the only thing that proves the test
has teeth.

Applied per tier:

1. **Bugs → failing repro first.** Write the reproduction as a committed test, watch it go
   red *for the defect's actual reason*, then fix to green. For a latency/liveness bug (e.g.
   a reconcile that stalls on dead-IP dials) the red is an observed stall or a broken
   invariant — not a downstream symptom that could go green again by timing luck.
2. **New pure/unit-testable logic → assertion first.** Write the assertion straight from the
   ADR/spec, see it fail, implement to green. Fast red-green lives here. Most sentinel/cluster
   healing decisions already have a pure seam for exactly this — `planLeaderlessRecovery`,
   `DetermineRealMaster`, `BestDataHolder`, and the injectable `Gatherer` interface behind
   `GatherClusterState` / `GatherClusterGroundTruth`.
3. **e2e-only behavior (reconcile/replication) → target assertion first.** Adjust the e2e to
   the intended behavior, confirm it is red against current code, then implement (slow loop
   accepted). Design corollary: push the *decision* into a thin pure function (as above) so it
   is unit-TDD-able fast, leaving e2e a thin integration shell. When the red is only reachable
   on a specific environment (e.g. a cloud whose dead pod IPs blackhole rather than RST),
   observing it there once satisfies the tier — but make the *repeatable* guard a tier-2 unit
   test, since the e2e will not go red in CI.

**Not dogmatic:** behavior-preserving refactors under already-green tests need no new red —
the existing tests are the guard. Red-first applies to new behavior and bug fixes. If a test
will not go red for the intended reason, treat it as a broken test and say so — do not paper
over it.

## 9. Key Resolved Investigations

### Sentinel Ghost Master Split-Brain (2026-02-20, LR-007/LR-008)
**Test:** `Sentinel Advanced Failover Hybrid (Production) Mode > should recover correctly with both mechanisms active (crash)`

**Root cause:** The hybrid test runs a graceful failover immediately followed by a crash failover on the same cluster. Two sentinels race to lead the second failover; one is superseded before it records `+switch-master` and is left permanently monitoring the ghost master IP — stuck at `s_down`, unable to reach `o_down` alone (quorum = 2). Classic non-self-healing split-brain caused entirely within Sentinel's election mechanism.

**Fix (LR-008):** Ghost master correction via `SENTINEL REMOVE` + `SENTINEL MONITOR <consensus-master-IP>`. A prior attempt with targeted `SENTINEL RESET` (LR-007) was found ineffective — RESET does not change the monitored master IP. The REMOVE+MONITOR sequence forces the stuck sentinel to immediately point at the correct living master. See `docs/RECONCILIATION_ALGORITHM_CHANGELOG.md` (LR-007, LR-008) and ADR-003.

### Leaderless Sentinel Bootstrap Deadlock (2026-07-09, LR-015)
**Symptom:** Two sentinel instances stuck not-serving for ~50 min after a mass pod restart. All Sentinels bare (monitoring nothing), all Redis pods `1/2 Running` (`redis-server` in the startup wait-loop). `RealMasterIP == ""`, so every consensus-master-gated healing rule short-circuited. Manual `SENTINEL MONITOR` on one sentinel (or a CR delete+redeploy) was required to recover.

**Root cause:** No re-bootstrap path for an already-initialized instance. `bootstrapRequired` is set once at `Phase == ""` and never re-armed; Rule 0 / LR-008 / LR-013 all require `RealMasterIP != ""`. So when the whole Sentinel quorum loses its config there is no rule that fires.

**Fix (LR-015):** Rule L (`recoverLeaderlessDeadlock`) — see pillar 3.10 and ADR-005. Data-aware: safe no-data reseed of `redis-0` by default; destructive rebootstrap-over-data only with `sentinel.allowUnsafeRebootstrapOnDeadlock`.

### Sentinel Liveness Probe Wiped Survivors During Leaderless Recovery (2026-07-12, LR-016)
**Symptom:** The Rule L e2e multi-holder tier failed — the operator `Reseeded` (saw 0 data holders) where it should have hit `RefusedDataPresent` (≥2 holders, opt-in off). Debug artifacts: both surviving replicas got `Container redis failed liveness probe, will be restarted` ~24s after their master died, restarted empty into the wait-loop, so the operator genuinely saw 0 holders.

**Root cause:** The sentinel liveness probe (ADR-003 2026-02-19 amendment) restarted any replica whose master was unreachable and not `role:master`/`link:up`, to self-heal "zombie" replicas following a ghost. But it cannot distinguish a zombie (a real master exists elsewhere) from a leaderless survivor (no master exists) — both are locally `role:slave` + `link:down` + master-unreachable — and in the leaderless case the restart wipes the survivor's data (EmptyDir), destroying what Rule L is meant to preserve.

**Fix (LR-016):** Reduced the sentinel liveness probe to a plain local health check (bootstrap guard + `PING`), matching standalone/cluster. Topology repair is operator-owned: Rule R (LR-009) redirects zombies via `SLAVEOF` without a restart; Rule L (LR-015) preserves/promotes leaderless survivors. Readiness (still `link:up`-gated) keeps a masterless replica out of traffic. See pillar 3.10 and the ADR-003 supersession note.

### Sentinel Reconcile Stalled ~146s on Blackholing Dead Pod IPs (2026-07-28, LR-017)
**Symptom:** On a managed cloud, the single-survivor leaderless-recovery e2e failed as "data lost" — `status.master.podName` stayed `redis-0` (the killed master, restarted empty). Rule L itself is correct (the local control run promoted the survivor); the operator simply never got to run it in time. Operator logs show one reconcile blocked **~146s** (the whole recovery window) dialing the killed Sentinels' stale IPs, which **blackholed** (`i/o timeout` / `no route to host`) one after another. Did **not** reproduce on local kubeadm, where killed IPs RST fast (`connection refused`) and the same paths return in ~2s.

**Root cause:** Missing per-probe deadline in two sentinel-mode paths that cluster mode already bounds (LR-012). (1) `GatherClusterState` probed every Redis/Sentinel pod **sequentially** (cluster's `gatherNodeIdentities` was made concurrent in LR-012; the sentinel loop never was). (2) The status/master-resolution path (`getMasterPodName` → `SentinelClient.GetMaster`/`GetMasterState`) loops `c.addresses` sequentially with `DefaultTimeout` (5s) + go-redis retries and **no per-address context deadline**. Informer-cache lag keeps killed sentinels listed `Ready`, so their stale IPs enter the list; each blackholing address burns ~`5s × retries`. The stall froze status at its stale bootstrap value and starved Rule L.

**Fix (LR-017):** Made `GatherClusterState` probe concurrently; renamed `ClusterProbeTimeout` → mode-neutral `ProbeTimeout` (3s) and wrapped the gatherer's `GetRedisState` and every `SentinelClient` read-path address loop in `context.WithTimeout(ctx, ProbeTimeout)`, so a dead address fails in ≤3s regardless of retries. The sentinel-mode completion of LR-012; the worked example for the cross-mode-parity rule (§7). See changelog LR-017.

**Verified on the managed cloud** (the environment that produced the 146s red): no-data + single-survivor tiers pass, probe timeout fires (`context deadline exceeded`) instead of hanging, recovery ~7s with no stall. The multi-holder e2e tier was separately flaky (a graceful master delete let the operator re-register returning bare Sentinels onto the still-`Terminating` master → ordinary data-safe failover, so it never even reached leaderless detection). Hardened that tier to force-delete, which reliably drives leaderless *detection* — but not the REFUSE *decision*: the operator's re-registration (Rule 0 / LR-008) can still recover the cluster during Rule L's 30s cooldown (also data-safe; this is what the verification run did). So the tier accepts either data-safe outcome and **always** asserts no data loss — a false negative must never become a false positive. The REFUSE gate itself stays guarded by `planLeaderlessRecovery` unit tests; e2e exercises it opportunistically, not deterministically.

### Cluster Consolidated-Shard Deadlock — Reshard Recovery (2026-07-29, LR-018)
**Symptom:** A field report (`debug-0720`, Redis 8.4.2 cluster, `shards:3`/`replicasPerShard:1`) stuck in `phase: Initializing` ~19h. Redis healthy (`cluster_state:ok`, 16384 slots) but one master owned two shard ranges (`0-5461`+`10923-16383`) while two pods were slotless empty masters — `CountMasters()==2 != shards`, `cluster_size:2`. Every ~2s reconcile logged "running repair" then did nothing.

**Root cause:** No repair branch could act. Step 3 (missing shards) checks each range has *an* owner, never a *distinct* one, so the double-ownership was invisible; Step 4 (empty-master reattach) only targets under-replicated slot-masters, and both slot-masters were already fully replicated. `IsHealthy` failed forever with no actionable step. The operator had no reshard/slot-migration capability. The state was most likely created by Step 3 itself: an EmptyDir mass-restart orphaned a range, and Step 3's stale pod-index→shard assumption re-added it to a pod already owning another range.

**Fix (LR-018):** Step 3b `reshardConsolidated` — detect via pure `PlanReshard`, relocate the surplus range onto an empty master **preserving keys** (no drop-keys opt-in; a non-lossy reshard always exists — contrast ADR-005). Mechanism by free gather-time capability probe: Redis 8.4+ native atomic slot migration (`CLUSTER MIGRATION IMPORT`), else the incremental key-preserving `reshardViaDance` (resumes from on-node IMPORTING/MIGRATING markers, key-count budget per reconcile). Cause closed in Step 3 via `SafeMissingShardTarget`. Exposed and fixed a latent `ParseClusterNodes` bug (migrating/importing `[...]` notations were parsed as owned slots). See ADR-006, pillar 3.11, changelog LR-018.

**Validated e2e on the lab:** ASM path on Redis 8.4.2 (300/300 keys, `cluster_size:3`); dance on Redis 7.4.0 (5000-key range drained in 3 passes, resumed from markers, 5000/5000 keys, no leftover markers). The parser bug was caught by the 7.4 e2e via `lrctl verify` — a mid-migration-topology defect unreachable by unit tests. Deferred sibling: LR-019 (replica rebalance).

### Cluster Per-Shard StatefulSets — Direction A complete (2026-07-30, LR-020/021/022)
**What:** cluster mode moved from one `{name}-cluster` StatefulSet (striped pod-index→shard) to **one StatefulSet per shard** `{name}-shard-K` with a stable `redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/shard` label, so single-failure-domain survivability (a shard's master + replica never share a node/zone) becomes expressible. See pillar 3.12, ADR-007. **Breaking (0.3.0)**: clean-slate cluster migration (EmptyDir); operator refuses to run beside a legacy single STS (`LegacyClusterTopology`) rather than delete data.

**Why *mandatory*, not cosmetic** (the load-bearing argument, in ADR-007 verbatim): a `topologySpreadConstraint` needs a stable, schedule-time, per-shard key; a single StatefulSet has one `spec.template` so every pod is stamped identically and K8s injects only ordinal/revision labels — **one template ⇒ no schedule-time shard key ⇒ only a bespoke mutating webhook could fake it.** Per-shard STSs express it declaratively.

**The "A is not free" finding (first e2e run):** the operator's own Step 4 empty-master reattach was shard-blind (`for _, m := range gt.Nodes`, random map order) and welded every replica to a *different* shard's master **at bootstrap** — decoupling Redis shards from shard STSs. Root cause is structural: **OSS Redis/Valkey Cluster has no failure-domain awareness** (rack-zone = Redis Enterprise only; Valkey AZ = client read routing), and both the reattach *and* Redis's autonomous replica migration re-pair across shards. Fixes: shard-aware `chooseReattachTarget` (red-first) + `cluster-allow-replica-migration no`. The operator is the sole topology authority.

**Three landed pieces:**
- **LR-020** — the split + shard-aware reattach + migration-off + colocation guards (`CheckShardColocation`; `lrctl verify` FAILs on cross-STS pairing + `[DEGRADED]` on `link:down`; e2e asserts colocation).
- **LR-021** — serialized rolling updates: `reconcileClusterStatefulSet` applies template *updates* one shard at a time (create-missing stays parallel), gating on `clusterShardRolloutSettled` (`ObservedGeneration==Generation` closes the cache-lag race), change detected via `AnnotationPodSpecHash`. The split had silently dropped the single STS's global one-pod-at-a-time serialization → parallel roll restarted all masters at once (availability dip, `corruptions:0`). Governs operator-triggered rollouts only.
- **LR-022** — `spec.placement.shardAntiAffinity {topologyKey, whenUnsatisfiable}` → per-shard `topologySpreadConstraint` (`maxSkew:1`, shard-label selector) injected per shard STS, appended to `spec.podTemplate` constraints. Defaults hostname + `ScheduleAnyway` (soft; CNPG/Strimzi convention). Cluster-only.

**Validated:** full e2e suite 82/82 (all modes + extended) green after LR-020/021; the LR-022 placement e2e proved same-shard pods land on **distinct nodes** on a real 3-node cluster (hard `DoNotSchedule`). **Deferred/tracked:** under-provisioning status condition (+cluster-wide `nodes` RBAC); Direction B (topology-aware master balancing); cluster total-wipe re-bootstrap (LR-015 analog). Work lives on `feat/per-shard-statefulsets`, merged to `e2e-0730`; `release/0.3.0` to be populated after review.

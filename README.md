# LittleRed

A Kubernetes operator for deploying Redis/Valkey as a pure in-memory data store.

LittleRed is built for workloads where persistence is explicitly disabled and never enabled—not even by accident. It provides a full reconciliation engine to manage node identities and cluster membership across restarts and failures: the class of problem where static Helm charts and startup scripts reach their limits.

## Upgrading to v0.3.0 (Cluster Mode)

> v0.3.0 restructures **cluster mode** from a single StatefulSet (`{name}-cluster`) into **one StatefulSet per shard** (`{name}-shard-K`, with pods `{name}-shard-K-0` … `-K-R`), so each shard's master and replica(s) can be pinned to separate failure domains. **`standalone` and `sentinel` instances are unaffected.**
>
> **Existing cluster instances migrate automatically — no action required.** When the upgraded operator finds a pre-0.3 `{name}-cluster` StatefulSet, it performs an **online, in-place, data-safe** migration to the per-shard layout: no delete-and-recreate, no data loss, and no change to client connection endpoints (the `{name}` client Service and the `{name}-cluster` headless Service are unchanged). It replicates each shard onto its new pods and hands ownership over with a coordinated failover, so every slot keeps at least two live copies throughout. Progress shows on `status.cluster.migration` and a `Ready=False` / `MigrationInProgress` condition until it reaches `Complete`.
>
> Only the **workload and pod names change** (`{name}-cluster-N` → `{name}-shard-K-M`) — update anything that references them directly (scripts, dashboards, NetworkPolicies). To pause the migration for a maintenance window, set the annotation `redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/migrate-legacy-sts: hold` before upgrading. See [Upgrading a pre-0.3 cluster](docs/USAGE.md#upgrading-a-pre-03-cluster).
>
> **New:** per-shard failure-domain isolation via `spec.placement.shardAntiAffinity` (spread each shard's master and replica(s) across nodes/zones). See [USAGE.md](docs/USAGE.md).

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Operator

```bash
helm upgrade --install littlered oci://ghcr.io/littlered-operator/charts/littlered \
  -n littlered-system --create-namespace
```

This installs the latest release. For a pinned version, add `--version <version>` — see the [releases page](https://github.com/littlered-operator/littlered-operator/releases).

By default the operator is cluster-scoped (watches all namespaces). To scope it to specific namespaces — for multi-tenancy, least-privilege RBAC, or running two operators side by side — see [Namespace Scoping](docs/USAGE.md#namespace-scoping).

### 2. Deploy an Instance

Set `spec.mode` to choose your deployment type:

```yaml
apiVersion: redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/v1alpha1
kind: LittleRed
metadata:
  name: my-store
spec:
  mode: sentinel   # standalone | sentinel | cluster
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f my-store.yaml
```

`standalone` runs a single Redis pod. `sentinel` runs 3 Redis pods (1 master + 2 replicas) monitored by 3 sentinels for automatic failover. `cluster` runs a sharded Redis Cluster across multiple pods for horizontal scaling.

### 3. Verify Health

```bash
# Install the CLI as a kubectl plugin
make install-plugin

# Check cluster consistency
kubectl lr verify my-store
```

## Key Features

- **Three deployment modes**: `standalone` (single pod), `sentinel` (1 master + 2 replicas monitored by 3 sentinels for automatic failover), and `cluster` (sharded Redis Cluster for horizontal scaling).
- **Redis 8.4.2 by default**, compatible with Redis 7.2+.
- **Burstable QoS by default**: memory limit equals request (preventing OOM surprises); a CPU *request* but no CPU *limit*. Redis's CPU use is bounded by its thread count, so a limit can only throttle it under load — size the request to the thread budget instead. Set an explicit CPU limit only if you need Guaranteed QoS.
- **`noeviction` by default**: memory exhaustion returns an error rather than silently dropping data. Explicitly configure a different policy if you need eviction semantics.
- **Per-shard failure-domain isolation (cluster mode)**: `spec.placement.shardAntiAffinity` spreads each shard's master and replica(s) across nodes/zones, so losing a single failure domain can't take out a whole shard.
- **Security**: password authentication and TLS encryption, both via Kubernetes Secrets.
- **Observability**: `redis_exporter` sidecar included by default, with optional `ServiceMonitor` for Prometheus.
- **`lrctl`**: a CLI tool (installable as a `kubectl lr` plugin) for direct state inspection and verification.

> **Current scope:** Cluster mode supports **3 or more shards** with configurable replicas per shard (default: 3 shards, 1 replica per shard).

## Why LittleRed?

Running Redis or Valkey without persistence creates a lifecycle problem that standard tooling doesn't handle well.

**The risk:** When a non-persistent node restarts, it comes back with an empty dataset. If it returns with its previous identity—same IP or hostname—the cluster may accept it as the authoritative source of truth and trigger a full sync from it, wiping data on healthy replicas.

**The solution:** LittleRed treats every restart as a new entity. It tracks node identities in Kubernetes, not inside Redis. When a pod disappears and a replacement arrives, the operator:

1. Removes the stale identity ("ghost node") from the cluster before the replacement joins.
2. Waits for any in-progress replica promotion to complete before healing the partition.
3. Intervenes with a forced promotion only when the cluster cannot self-recover (e.g., quorum loss).

The core principle is **minimal interference**: trust Sentinel and Cluster Gossip to handle their own state transitions, and intervene only when the cluster lacks the context to heal itself—specifically when it cannot see what the Kubernetes API already knows (that a pod is gone for good).

## Behind the Name

The name **LittleRed** is an homage to the fable of the *Little Red Hen*. When we searched for a tool that handled the complexities of pure in-memory Redis lifecycles with technical rigor, we found that the existing solutions were often unmaintained or focused on different problems. Like the hen in the story, we decided to build it ourselves.

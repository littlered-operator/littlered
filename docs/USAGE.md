# Using LittleRed

This guide shows how to deploy and use Redis instances with the LittleRed operator.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.28+
- `kubectl` configured to access your cluster
- Helm 3.x (for Helm installation)

---

## Installing the Operator

### Option 1: Helm (Recommended)

```bash
# From the published OCI chart (recommended)
helm upgrade --install littlered oci://ghcr.io/littlered-operator/charts/littlered \
  -n littlered-system --create-namespace

# For a pinned version, add: --version <version>
```

Or from a source checkout:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/littlered-operator/littlered-operator.git
helm upgrade --install littlered ./littlered-operator/charts/littlered \
  -n littlered-system --create-namespace
```

#### Verify installation

```bash
# Check operator pod is running
kubectl get pods -n littlered-system

# Expected output:
# NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
# littlered-operator-xxxxxxxxx-xxxxx   1/1     Running   0          30s

# Check CRD is installed
kubectl get crd littlereds.redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net
```

#### Custom configuration

Create a `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
image:
  repository: ghcr.io/littlered-operator/littlered
  # tag: ""   # defaults to the chart's appVersion — pin only to override

resources:
  limits:
    cpu: 500m
    memory: 256Mi
  requests:
    cpu: 100m
    memory: 128Mi

# For HA setups (multiple operator replicas)
replicas: 2
```

> Leader election is always enabled in the operator, so running multiple
> replicas is safe: only the pod holding the lease reconciles, regardless of
> how the deployment is scaled (via Helm or directly with `kubectl`/`k9s`).

# Optional: spread the operator replicas across nodes (only meaningful with replicas > 1).

```yaml
topologySpreadConstraints:
  - maxSkew: 1
    topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
    whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
    labelSelector:
      matchLabels:
        control-plane: controller-manager
```

> Leader election (chart default `true`) ensures only one operator pod reconciles at a
> time; the standby takes over on leader loss. `replicas > 1` gives you HA against pod or
> process failure; add `topologySpreadConstraints` (or `affinity`) to also survive a node
> or zone loss.

Install with custom values:

```bash
helm upgrade --install littlered oci://ghcr.io/littlered-operator/charts/littlered \
  -n littlered-system --create-namespace \
  -f values.yaml
```

#### Upgrade

```bash
helm upgrade littlered oci://ghcr.io/littlered-operator/charts/littlered -n littlered-system
```

**Important: Upgrading CRDs**

Helm does not automatically update CRDs on `helm upgrade`. If the LittleRed CRD schema has changed (e.g., new fields like `spec.cluster`), you must apply the CRD manually:

```bash
kubectl apply -f charts/littlered/crds/redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net_littlereds.yaml
```

#### Uninstall

```bash
helm uninstall littlered -n littlered-system

# CRDs are not deleted automatically. To remove them:
kubectl delete crd littlereds.redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net
```

### Option 2: ArgoCD

Create an ArgoCD Application:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: littlered-operator
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/littlered-operator/littlered-operator.git
    targetRevision: main          # or a release tag, e.g. v0.3.0
    path: charts/littlered
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: littlered-system
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
    syncOptions:
      - CreateNamespace=true
```

---

## Namespace Scoping

By default the operator is **cluster-scoped**: it watches every `LittleRed` CR in
every namespace and ships cluster-wide RBAC (a `ClusterRole` + `ClusterRoleBinding`).
This is unchanged — scoping is entirely opt-in, and leaving both settings below empty
gives you exactly today's behavior.

Scoping lets you restrict which namespaces an operator manages, so more than one
operator can safely share a cluster. It is expressed as *the operator's watch-list*
(which namespaces this operator owns), configured through two **mutually exclusive**
Helm values (set **at most one**):

| Value | Env var set on the operator | Mode | RBAC |
|-------|-----------------------------|------|------|
| `scope.watchNamespaces` | `WATCH_NAMESPACE` | Allow-list — watch only these namespaces | Namespaced `Role` + `RoleBinding` per namespace (least-privilege); no `ClusterRole` |
| `scope.ignoreNamespaces` | `IGNORE_NAMESPACE` | Deny-list — watch all namespaces *except* these | Cluster-wide `ClusterRole` (kept) |
| *(neither set — default)* | *(none)* | Cluster-scoped (all namespaces) | Cluster-wide `ClusterRole` |

The CRD is always installed cluster-wide (from the chart's `crds/`); only the CR
*instances* are namespaced.

### Allow-list mode (`scope.watchNamespaces`)

The operator's informers and reconcilers see **only** the listed namespaces. Because
it needs no cluster-wide reach, the chart drops the `ClusterRole`/`ClusterRoleBinding`
and instead renders the same reconcile permissions as a **`Role` + `RoleBinding` in
each watched namespace**, bound to the operator's ServiceAccount (which stays in the
operator's own namespace). This is the least-privilege deployment.

Use it for a single-tenant or per-team operator ("this operator manages only the
`team-a` namespace"), or to manage a specific set of namespaces:

```bash
helm upgrade --install littlered oci://ghcr.io/littlered-operator/charts/littlered \
  -n littlered-system --create-namespace \
  --set scope.watchNamespaces={team-a,team-b}
```

This sets `WATCH_NAMESPACE="team-a,team-b"` on the operator and renders a
`littlered-manager` `Role` + `RoleBinding` in both `team-a` and `team-b`.

### Deny-list mode (`scope.ignoreNamespaces`)

The operator watches **all namespaces except** the listed ones. This is the "one
global operator, but hands off these" model — it inherently watches cluster-wide, so
it keeps the `ClusterRole` (there is no least-privilege gain to be had, which is
expected for a global operator).

```yaml
# values.yaml
scope:
  ignoreNamespaces:
    - staging
```

This sets `IGNORE_NAMESPACE="staging"` on the operator; the operator reconciles every
namespace but leaves `staging` entirely alone.

### Mutual exclusivity

`scope.watchNamespaces` and `scope.ignoreNamespaces` are mutually exclusive. Setting
both is a **fail-fast error in two places**: the Helm chart refuses to render, and if
both env vars are somehow set the operator exits at startup rather than guessing a
merge.

### The multi-operator partition pattern (staged rollout)

The headline use is running two operators side by side with **zero overlap** — for
example, to stage a new operator version against one namespace without touching the
rest of the cluster:

- A **global** operator with `scope.ignoreNamespaces: [staging]` — manages everything
  except `staging`.
- A **second** operator (e.g. a new version) with `scope.watchNamespaces: [staging]` —
  manages only `staging`.

Their watch-lists are disjoint, so no CR is reconciled by both operators
(no double-reconcile), and each gets its own leader lease (see below). When the new
version is validated in `staging`, promote it to the rest of the cluster.

### Leader election and `POD_NAMESPACE`

The operator's leader-election lease lives in its **own** namespace: the chart wires
the downward-API `POD_NAMESPACE` env var (from `metadata.namespace`) so a scoped
operator's lease never lives cluster-wide. In addition, the lease **ID is derived from
the operator's scope** (mode + namespace set), so two operators with disjoint
watch-lists never contend for the same lease — the unscoped default keeps the original
fixed lease ID, unchanged. No configuration is needed for this; it follows from the
`scope.*` values.

---

## Standalone Mode

A single Redis instance for development or simple caching.

### Deploy

```yaml
# standalone.yaml
apiVersion: redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/v1alpha1
kind: LittleRed
metadata:
  name: store
spec:
  mode: standalone
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f standalone.yaml
```

### Verify

```bash
# Check status
kubectl get littlered store

# Expected output:
# NAME       MODE         PHASE     READY   AGE
# store   standalone   Running   1       30s

# Check pods
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=store

# Check service
kubectl get svc store
```

### Connect

```bash
# Test Redis connection
kubectl exec -it store-redis-0 -c redis -- redis-cli PING
# Output: PONG

# Set and get a value
kubectl exec -it store-redis-0 -c redis -- redis-cli SET hello world
kubectl exec -it store-redis-0 -c redis -- redis-cli GET hello
# Output: world

# Check Redis info
kubectl exec -it store-redis-0 -c redis -- redis-cli INFO server
```

### Connect from your application

```bash
# Service endpoint
store.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:6379
```

---

## Sentinel Mode

High-availability setup with automatic failover: 3 Redis pods (1 master + 2 replicas) and 3 Sentinel pods.

### Deploy

```yaml
# sentinel.yaml
apiVersion: redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/v1alpha1
kind: LittleRed
metadata:
  name: store
spec:
  mode: sentinel
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f sentinel.yaml
```

### Verify

```bash
# Check status
kubectl get littlered store

# Expected output:
# NAME       MODE       PHASE     READY   AGE
# store   sentinel   Running   3       2m

# Check all pods (3 Redis + 3 Sentinel)
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=store

# Expected:
# store-redis-0      2/2     Running
# store-redis-1      2/2     Running
# store-redis-2      2/2     Running
# store-sentinel-0   1/1     Running
# store-sentinel-1   1/1     Running
# store-sentinel-2   1/1     Running

# Check services
kubectl get svc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=store

# Expected:
# store            ClusterIP   ...   6379/TCP,9121/TCP   (master)
# store-replicas   ClusterIP   ...   6379/TCP,9121/TCP   (all replicas)
# store-sentinel   ClusterIP   ...   26379/TCP           (sentinels)
```

### Check replication

```bash
# Query sentinel for master
kubectl exec -it store-sentinel-0 -- redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster

# Check master info
kubectl exec -it store-sentinel-0 -- redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL master mymaster

# Check replicas
kubectl exec -it store-sentinel-0 -- redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL replicas mymaster
```

### Test failover

```bash
# Find current master
kubectl get littlered store -o jsonpath='{.status.master.podName}'

# Kill the master pod
kubectl delete pod store-redis-0 --grace-period=0 --force

# Watch failover (new master elected in ~5-30 seconds)
kubectl get littlered store -w

# Verify new master
kubectl exec -it store-sentinel-0 -- redis-cli -p 26379 SENTINEL get-master-addr-by-name mymaster
```

### Connect from your application

For sentinel-aware clients:

```
Sentinel endpoints: store-sentinel.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:26379
Master name: mymaster
```

For simple clients (connects to current master):

```
store.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:6379
```

---

## Failover Mode (Experimental)

Operator-managed high availability **without Sentinel**: 1 master +
`spec.failover.replicas` replicas (default 2), and the operator itself performs
failure detection and failover (ADR-011). It is the same logical topology as
sentinel mode minus the 3 Sentinel pods.

**Status: experimental.** The mode is under active validation — the operator
emits a warning event (`ExperimentalMode`) on the first reconcile of a
failover-mode instance, and its e2e/chaos validation (the graduation gate
written in `docs/FAILOVER_MODE_DESIGN.md` §4) is still in progress. `sentinel`
mode remains fully supported; choose for yourself based on the trade-off below.

**The trade-off, honestly:** failover mode couples HA to **operator liveness**.
If the operator is down when a master dies, failover waits until the operator
is back (mitigations: operator leader election with multiple replicas, fast
restart, and a background watcher that keeps detection in the seconds range).
In exchange there is only **one** failure detector — the class of
operator-vs-Sentinel races that produced the hardest sentinel-mode deadlocks
(see the LR-007/LR-008 and LR-024 entries in
`docs/RECONCILIATION_ALGORITHM_CHANGELOG.md`) does not exist, and clients are
routed by a single authority (the operator's `role: master` label, which is
what routes sentinel-mode traffic anyway).

### Deploy

```yaml
# failover.yaml
apiVersion: redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/v1alpha1
kind: LittleRed
metadata:
  name: store
spec:
  mode: failover

  # Optional: customize failover settings (defaults shown)
  failover:
    replicas: 2                  # data pods = 1 + replicas
    downAfterMilliseconds: 5000  # sustained-failure window before the operator declares the master dead
    minReplicasToWrite: 0        # 0 = off; >0 bounds write loss at the cost of write availability
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f failover.yaml
```

### Verify

```bash
# Check status
kubectl get littlered store

# Expected output:
# NAME       MODE       PHASE     READY   AGE
# store   failover   Running   3       1m

# Check pods (1 master + 2 replicas, NO sentinel pods)
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=store

# Expected:
# store-redis-0      2/2     Running
# store-redis-1      2/2     Running
# store-redis-2      2/2     Running

# Check services
kubectl get svc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=store

# Expected:
# store            ClusterIP   ...   6379/TCP,9121/TCP   (routes to current master)
# store-replicas   ClusterIP   ...   6379/TCP,9121/TCP   (all data pods, headless)

# The operator's role assignments live on the pods as annotations:
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=store \
  -o custom-columns='NAME:.metadata.name,ROLE:.metadata.annotations.redis\.chuck-chuck-chuck\.net/assigned-role,EPOCH:.metadata.annotations.redis\.chuck-chuck-chuck\.net/assignment-epoch'
```

### Test failover

```bash
# Find current master
kubectl get littlered store -o jsonpath='{.status.master.podName}'

# Kill the master pod
kubectl delete pod store-redis-0 --grace-period=0 --force

# Watch the operator promote a replica (detection is immediate on pod loss;
# probe-evidenced failures wait downAfterMilliseconds)
kubectl get littlered store -w

# Inspect the failover monitoring surfaces
kubectl get littlered store -o jsonpath='{.status.failover}'
```

### Connect from your application

There are no Sentinel endpoints; use a plain (non-sentinel-aware) client
against the master service — the operator keeps it pointed at the current
master via the `role: master` label:

```
store.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:6379
```

### Data-safety opt-in: allowUnsafeRebootstrapOnDeadlock

If the instance ever reaches a no-master state, the operator resolves it
data-aware, gated on replication **lineage** (not a raw holder count):

- **No pod holds data** → it reseeds `redis-0`. Automatic, nothing to lose.
- **Survivors hold data on a single replication lineage** (this includes the
  normal promotion chain left behind by earlier failovers) → it promotes the
  most-complete survivor. Automatic and safe — the other survivors resync from
  the winner, no independent writes are discarded. **No opt-in needed.**
- **Survivors span two or more independent lineages** → electing any one would
  discard the writes unique to the others, so the operator **refuses**: it
  raises the `FailoverRecovery` condition with reason `RefusedDataPresent` and
  waits for a human. Setting `spec.failover.allowUnsafeRebootstrapOnDeadlock: true`
  authorizes it to force-elect the most-complete pod instead — the divergent
  data on the other lineages is discarded via full resync. Enable only where
  data loss is acceptable (e.g. caches).

Note the difference from the sentinel-mode field of the same name: the sentinel
gate refuses on **≥2 data holders**; the failover gate refuses only on **≥2
divergent lineages**, so a plain multi-replica survivor set recovers
automatically.

---

## Cluster Mode

Horizontally scaled setup with automatic sharding across multiple master nodes. Data is distributed using hash slots (16384 total). No PersistentVolumes required - cluster state is stored in the CR status.

### Deploy

```yaml
# cluster.yaml
apiVersion: redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/v1alpha1
kind: LittleRed
metadata:
  name: store
spec:
  mode: cluster
  cluster:
    shards: 3           # Number of master nodes (minimum 3)
    replicasPerShard: 1 # Replicas per master (0 = no replicas)
```

```bash
kubectl apply -f cluster.yaml
```

### Verify

```bash
# Check status
kubectl get littlered store

# Expected output:
# NAME       MODE      PHASE     READY   AGE
# store   cluster   Running   6       2m

# Check all pods (3 masters + 3 replicas = 6 pods, spread across one
# StatefulSet per shard: store-shard-0, store-shard-1, store-shard-2)
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=store

# Expected (pod -K-0 is shard K's master, -K-1 its replica):
# store-shard-0-0   2/2     Running   (shard-0 master)
# store-shard-0-1   2/2     Running   (shard-0 replica)
# store-shard-1-0   2/2     Running   (shard-1 master)
# store-shard-1-1   2/2     Running   (shard-1 replica)
# store-shard-2-0   2/2     Running   (shard-2 master)
# store-shard-2-1   2/2     Running   (shard-2 replica)

# Check services
kubectl get svc -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=store

# Expected:
# store           ClusterIP   ...   6379/TCP,9121/TCP         (client access)
# store-cluster   ClusterIP   None  6379/TCP,16379/TCP        (headless for cluster)
```

### Check cluster health

```bash
# Cluster info
kubectl exec -it store-shard-0-0 -c redis -- redis-cli CLUSTER INFO

# Expected output includes:
# cluster_state:ok
# cluster_slots_assigned:16384
# cluster_slots_ok:16384
# cluster_known_nodes:6
# cluster_size:3

# Cluster nodes (shows all nodes with their roles and slots)
kubectl exec -it store-shard-0-0 -c redis -- redis-cli CLUSTER NODES

# Check slot distribution
kubectl exec -it store-shard-0-0 -c redis -- redis-cli CLUSTER SLOTS
```

### Check cluster state in CR status

```bash
# View stored cluster topology
kubectl get littlered store -o jsonpath='{.status.cluster}' | jq

# Expected output:
# {
#   "state": "ok",
#   "lastBootstrap": "2026-02-03T...",
#   "nodes": [
#     {"podName": "store-shard-0-0", "nodeId": "abc123...", "role": "master", "slotRanges": "0-5460"},
#     {"podName": "store-shard-0-1", "nodeId": "def456...", "role": "replica", "masterNodeId": "abc123..."},
#     ...
#   ]
# }
```

### Test recovery

```bash
# Delete a master pod (shard-0's master)
kubectl delete pod store-shard-0-0

# Watch the operator recover (new pod gets new node ID, operator re-adds slots)
kubectl logs -n littlered-system deployment/littlered-operator -f

# Verify cluster health from a surviving pod (shard-1's master)
kubectl exec -it store-shard-1-0 -c redis -- redis-cli CLUSTER INFO
```

### Connect from your application

Redis Cluster clients automatically discover all nodes:

```
Initial endpoint: store.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local:6379
```

Example with redis-cli:

```bash
# -c flag enables cluster mode (follows redirects)
kubectl exec -it store-shard-0-0 -c redis -- redis-cli -c SET mykey myvalue
kubectl exec -it store-shard-0-0 -c redis -- redis-cli -c GET mykey
```

### Slot distribution

With 3 shards, slots are distributed as:
- Shard 0 (`store-shard-0-0`): slots 0-5460
- Shard 1 (`store-shard-1-0`): slots 5461-10922
- Shard 2 (`store-shard-2-0`): slots 10923-16383

### Important notes

- **Supported topologies**: **3 or more shards** with **0 or more replicas per shard** (default: 3 shards, 1 replica). The minimum of 3 is a Redis Cluster requirement — it needs at least 3 masters. Both counts are validated (`shards ≥ 3`, `replicasPerShard ≥ 0`).
- **In-memory mode**: No persistence. Data will be lost on full cluster restart. By default, 'noeviction' is used, so data is not forgotten when memory is full (Redis will return errors instead).
- **No PVCs**: Cluster state stored in CR status, not nodes.conf.
- **Runtime scaling**: reducing `spec.cluster.shards` is refused (`ShardScaleDownRefused` — the operator never deletes data). Automated shard scale-up (resharding slots onto new shards) is not yet supported; treat the shard count as fixed after creation.

### Upgrading a pre-0.3 cluster

0.3.0 restructures cluster mode from a single StatefulSet (`{name}-cluster`, pods
`{name}-cluster-N`) into **one StatefulSet per shard** (`{name}-shard-K`, pods
`{name}-shard-K-M` where `-K-0` is the shard master and `-K-1…-K-R` its replicas), so
each shard's master and replica(s) can be pinned to separate failure domains (see
[shardAntiAffinity](#spreading-pods-across-nodes-and-failure-domains)).

**The migration is automatic, online, and data-safe — no action is required.** When the
upgraded operator finds a legacy `{name}-cluster` StatefulSet, it migrates the instance
in place to the per-shard layout, on the same running Redis Cluster:

- Each new per-shard pod joins as a **slot-less replica** of the legacy master that owns
  its range and full-syncs; then `{name}-shard-K-0` is promoted by a coordinated
  `CLUSTER FAILOVER` (an atomic ownership flip). Slots are never moved, so every slot
  keeps at least two live copies at every instant — **no data loss**, and no window where
  a shard serves from a single copy.
- **Client connection endpoints do not change.** The client Service `{name}` and the
  headless Service `{name}-cluster` are shard-agnostic and keep fronting the pods
  throughout, so applications are unaffected.
- Progress is reported on `status.cluster.migration` (`phase`, `shardsMoved`,
  `totalShards`) and a `Ready=False` / `MigrationInProgress` condition. The phases are
  `Standup → Meet → Replicate → Failover → Decommission → Complete`. When it reaches
  `Complete`, the operator removes the legacy `{name}-cluster` StatefulSet automatically
  and the instance returns to steady state.

What to keep in mind:

- **Only the workload and pod names change** (`{name}-cluster-N` → `{name}-shard-K-M`).
  Update anything that references them directly — scripts, dashboards, NetworkPolicies,
  `kubectl exec` one-liners.
- The migration is **shape-preserving**: it moves the *same* topology (same `shards`, same
  `replicasPerShard`) onto the new layout. It begins only once the legacy cluster is
  healthy (`cluster_state:ok`, all 16384 slots assigned, all legacy pods Ready, a reachable
  master quorum), and a non-shape-preserving legacy cluster is refused
  (`MigrationUnsupportedTopology`). Change `shards`/`replicasPerShard` only **after** the
  migration completes.
- Reducing `spec.cluster.shards` is always refused (`ShardScaleDownRefused`).

**Pausing the migration (opt-out).** To hold a legacy cluster in its current shape — for a
change-control window, say — set the annotation before (or during) the upgrade:

```bash
kubectl annotate littlered <instance> redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/migrate-legacy-sts=hold
```

While held, the operator makes **no changes** and surfaces a `MigrationHeld` condition.
Note the trade-off: holding also **suspends the operator's repair loop** for that instance,
so the legacy cluster keeps serving but is effectively **unmanaged** (no ghost-node healing,
no failover assistance) until you remove the annotation:

```bash
kubectl annotate littlered <instance> redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/migrate-legacy-sts-
```

Removing it lets the migration proceed to `Complete`.

## Custom Configuration

### With resources and memory policy

```yaml
apiVersion: redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/v1alpha1
kind: LittleRed
metadata:
  name: store
spec:
  mode: standalone

  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: "500m"       # CPU request only — set a request, not a limit
      memory: "1Gi"
    limits:
      memory: "1Gi"     # memory limit == request; no CPU limit (Burstable QoS)

  config:
    maxmemory: "900Mi"
    maxmemoryPolicy: noeviction
```

> **Why a CPU request but no CPU limit?** Redis's CPU usage is *bounded by its
> thread count*, not unbounded. Command execution runs on a single main thread;
> enabling `io-threads` adds a fixed number of I/O threads for socket
> reads/writes and protocol parsing (the `io-threads` count *includes* the main
> thread). So Redis will only ever saturate the cores its threads occupy —
> never more. Size the CPU **request** to that thread budget so the scheduler
> reserves the cores Redis can actually use, and set a memory limit equal to the
> memory request to bound the node (Burstable QoS).
>
> A CPU **limit**, by contrast, has no upside. Redis can't exceed its thread
> budget regardless, so a limit can only *throttle* it under load — and a
> throttled Redis just produces rising latency, piled-up requests, and client
> timeouts that cascade into every service that depends on it. Nobody benefits
> from that. Set an explicit CPU limit only if your platform mandates the
> Guaranteed QoS class.
>
> If you enable `io-threads` for higher throughput, raise the CPU request to
> match (e.g. `io-threads: 3` → request ~3–4 CPUs). On Redis 8, `io-threads`
> threads both reads and writes automatically — the old `io-threads-do-reads`
> setting is obsolete.

### With a PodDisruptionBudget

A PodDisruptionBudget (PDB) protects a multi-pod instance from losing too many
pods at once during voluntary disruptions (node drains, upgrades). PDB creation
is opt-in; enable it for any HA instance (sentinel or cluster):

### Spreading pods across nodes and failure domains

`spec.podTemplate` passes the full set of Kubernetes pod-scheduling controls
through to the managed pods **verbatim** — `nodeSelector`, `tolerations`,
`affinity`, `priorityClassName`, and `topologySpreadConstraints`. There is no
LittleRed-specific placement DSL: you express placement with the native
Kubernetes primitives, which cover the full range of requirements (one pod per
node, spread across zones, dedicated node pools, and so on). The operator does
**not** inject a default anti-affinity or spread, and it does **not** augment
your `labelSelector` — what you write is what the pods get.

Select the instance's pods with `app.kubernetes.io/instance: <metadata.name>`.
Note that `app.kubernetes.io/name` is always the constant `littlered` (it is the
*application* name, not the instance name), so a selector keyed on it will match
every LittleRed pod in the cluster — use `app.kubernetes.io/instance`.

**One pod per node** (hard requirement):

```yaml
spec:
  podTemplate:
    topologySpreadConstraints:
      - maxSkew: 1
        topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
        whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule      # refuse to schedule rather than co-locate
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app.kubernetes.io/instance: store
```

**Spread across availability zones** — swap the topology key:

```yaml
      - maxSkew: 1
        topologyKey: topology.kubernetes.io/zone
        whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule
        labelSelector:
          matchLabels:
            app.kubernetes.io/instance: store
```

Use `whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway` for a soft preference (best-effort spread
that still schedules when domains run short), or a `requiredDuringScheduling`
`podAntiAffinity` on `kubernetes.io/hostname` for a strict one-per-node rule.

**Sentinel mode — master/replica domain diversity is fully covered.** The three
Redis data pods form a single StatefulSet; spreading all three across nodes or
zones guarantees the master and its two replicas land in different domains — and
that holds across failover, because a failover only changes *which* pod is master,
it never moves a pod. Apply the spread above to a `mode: sentinel` instance and
you are done.

**Cluster mode — per-shard isolation via `spec.placement.shardAntiAffinity`.**
The instance-wide `spec.podTemplate` constraint above spreads *all* of an
instance's cluster pods evenly across the chosen domains, but it cannot keep an
*individual shard's* master and replica(s) apart: a single shared `labelSelector`
selects every pod of the instance, not one shard's. As of 0.3.0 each shard is its
own StatefulSet (`{name}-shard-K`) whose pods carry a stable, schedule-time
`redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/shard` label — but that label is operator-owned, so
you cannot practically write a spread constraint against it yourself. The
`spec.placement.shardAntiAffinity` knob does it for you: the operator injects a
per-shard `topologySpreadConstraint` (`maxSkew: 1`, `labelSelector` scoped to that
shard's pods) into **each** shard StatefulSet, so a shard's master and replica(s)
never share the chosen failure domain.

```yaml
apiVersion: redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/v1alpha1
kind: LittleRed
metadata:
  name: store
spec:
  mode: cluster
  cluster:
    shards: 3
    replicasPerShard: 1
  placement:
    shardAntiAffinity:
      topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname   # spread a shard's pods across nodes
      whenUnsatisfiable: DoNotSchedule       # hard: refuse to co-locate a shard's pods
```

Two fields:

- **`topologyKey`** (default `kubernetes.io/hostname`) — the node label defining the
  failure domain to spread a shard's pods across. Use `topology.kubernetes.io/zone`
  to spread a shard's pods across availability zones instead of nodes.
- **`whenUnsatisfiable`** (default `ScheduleAnyway`) — `ScheduleAnyway` is a *soft*
  preference: best-effort spread that still schedules a shard's pods when domains
  run short (small/dev/single-node clusters still come up). `DoNotSchedule` is a
  *hard* guarantee that a shard's pods never co-locate — but it can leave pods
  `Pending` when there are fewer failure domains than a shard has pods (e.g.
  `DoNotSchedule` on `kubernetes.io/hostname` with `replicasPerShard: 1` needs at
  least 2 schedulable nodes per shard). The default is soft to match the
  "enable, don't force" philosophy; opt into `DoNotSchedule` for production.

The operator's per-shard constraint is **appended** to any
`spec.podTemplate.topologySpreadConstraints` you supply — both apply, so you can
still layer an instance-wide zone spread (or any other constraint) on top of the
shard-scoped one. `spec.placement.shardAntiAffinity` is **cluster mode only**;
validation rejects it in standalone and sentinel mode (where a single StatefulSet
already covers master/replica domain diversity — see above).

> **Known limitation.** There is no dedicated under-provisioning status condition
> yet — the operator does not count cluster nodes or failure domains. With
> `DoNotSchedule` and too few domains you will see standard `Pending` pods,
> surfaced through the CR's readiness (`status.redis.ready < total`, phase

## Rolling Restarts and Updates

### Overview

When you update a LittleRed resource (e.g., change image version, resource limits, or configuration), the operator triggers a rolling restart of the StatefulSet. The `minReadySeconds` setting controls how long to wait after each pod becomes ready before restarting the next pod.

### Why minReadySeconds Matters

For Redis deployments with high availability (replicas or sentinel), restarting pods too quickly can cause:

- **Cluster mode**: Multiple masters down simultaneously, losing quorum
- **Sentinel mode**: Master restarts before sentinel detects failure and promotes a replica
- **Data unavailability**: Clients can't reach Redis during cascading failures

The `minReadySeconds` setting ensures:
1. Pod is fully ready and healthy
2. Failover (if needed) completes successfully
3. Cluster stabilizes before next pod restarts

### Default Behavior

| Mode | Default minReadySeconds | Reason |
|------|------------------------|--------|
| Cluster with replicas | 30s | Allows automatic failover (cluster-node-timeout + promotion + buffer) |
| Sentinel mode | 35s | Allows sentinel-managed failover (down-after-milliseconds + promotion) |
| Failover mode | 15s | Operator-led handover is faster than Sentinel's (default 5s detection window + promote/repoint); 15s lets a transition settle before the next pod rolls |
| Standalone or 0-replica | 0s | No failover mechanism, immediate restart is safe |

### Performing a Rolling Restart

#### Trigger via kubectl

```bash
# Standalone / sentinel: a single StatefulSet
kubectl rollout restart statefulset <name> -n <namespace>

# Cluster mode is one StatefulSet PER SHARD ({name}-shard-K). Roll them one at a time,
# waiting for each to settle, so you never restart two shard masters at once:
kubectl rollout restart statefulset my-cluster-shard-0 -n default
kubectl rollout status  statefulset my-cluster-shard-0 -n default
# …then my-cluster-shard-1, my-cluster-shard-2, and so on.
```

> **Prefer a CR update for cluster mode.** When a pod-template change arrives through the CR
> (below), the operator rolls the shard StatefulSets **one at a time**, waiting for each to
> settle before the next — so only one shard master restarts at a time. A manual
> `kubectl rollout restart` of every shard StatefulSet at once bypasses that serialization.

#### Trigger via CR Update

Change any field that affects the pod template (image, resources, config):

```bash
kubectl patch littlered my-cluster -n default --type merge -p '
spec:
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "256Mi"
'
```

#### Monitor Rollout Status

```bash
# Watch rollout progress (cluster mode: one StatefulSet per shard, check each)
kubectl rollout status statefulset my-cluster-shard-0 -n default

# Check pod restarts
kubectl get pods -n default -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=my-cluster -w
```

### Customizing minReadySeconds

If you need faster or slower rolling restarts, you can override the default:

```yaml
apiVersion: redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/v1alpha1
kind: LittleRed
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  mode: cluster
  cluster:
    shards: 3
    replicasPerShard: 1
  updateStrategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    minReadySeconds: 45  # Wait 45s between pod restarts
```

**Use cases for customization:**

- **Faster restarts** (e.g., `minReadySeconds: 15`): For clusters with very short cluster-node-timeout or when you've verified failover completes quickly
- **Slower restarts** (e.g., `minReadySeconds: 60`): For large clusters with many keys where replication catch-up takes time
- **Testing** (`minReadySeconds: 0`): For development environments where you want rapid rollouts

**Valid range:** 0-300 seconds

### Example: Safe Production Rolling Restart

```yaml
apiVersion: redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/v1alpha1
kind: LittleRed
metadata:
  name: prod-cluster
spec:
  mode: cluster
  cluster:
    shards: 5
    replicasPerShard: 2
    clusterNodeTimeout: 15000  # 15s default
  updateStrategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
    minReadySeconds: 40  # Conservative: 15s + 10s promotion + 15s buffer
  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: "500m"
      memory: "1Gi"
    limits:
      memory: "1Gi"     # memory limit == request; no CPU limit (Burstable QoS)
```

**Rollout timeline for this config:**
- Pod 0 terminates, new pod 0 starts
- New pod 0 becomes ready
- **Wait 40 seconds** (minReadySeconds)
- Repeat for pod 1, 2, 3, etc.
- Total time: ~(40s × 10 pods) = 6-7 minutes for full rollout

### Testing Rolling Restarts

You can test rolling restart behavior with the e2e test suite:

```bash
DEBUG_ON_FAILURE=true make test-e2e-cluster-chaos
```

The `should maintain data integrity during rolling restart` test verifies:
- 0 data corruptions
- ≥95% read availability during rollout
- All slots remain assigned (cluster_slots_assigned:16384)

## High-Throughput Tuning (I/O threads)

By default Redis runs its network I/O on the main thread. On a busy instance
that main thread can become the bottleneck long before memory or the network
does. Enabling **I/O threads** lets Redis offload socket reads, writes, and
protocol parsing to additional threads, while command execution stays on the
main thread (so atomicity is preserved). This is a *vertical* throughput lever
and is independent of mode — it applies to standalone, sentinel, and cluster
instances alike.

Enable it via `config.raw` and size the CPU **request** to match the thread
count:

```yaml
apiVersion: redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/v1alpha1
kind: LittleRed
metadata:
  name: store
spec:
  mode: cluster
  cluster:
    shards: 3
    replicasPerShard: 1

  resources:
    requests:
      cpu: "4"          # ~ io-threads budget (incl. main) + 1 spare core
      memory: "8Gi"
    limits:
      memory: "8Gi"     # memory limit == request; deliberately NO CPU limit

  config:
    maxmemory: "6gb"    # leave headroom below the memory limit
    raw: |-
      # I/O threads: offload socket reads/writes + protocol parsing.
      # The count INCLUDES the main thread, so "3" = main + 2 helpers.
      # Redis docs suggest (cores - 1); leave at least one spare core.
      io-threads 3

      # Accept-queue depth for bursty connection storms (default 511). The
      # kernel caps this at net.core.somaxconn, so raising it only helps if the
      # node's sysctl is also raised; otherwise the effective backlog is
      # somaxconn. Cheap to set, so a higher ceiling is "free".
      tcp-backlog 4096
```

**Sizing rule of thumb:**

| `io-threads` | Threads doing I/O (incl. main) | Suggested CPU request |
|--------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------|
| unset / `1`  | 1 (main only)                 | ~1 (the default `128m`–`1` range) |
| `3`          | 3                             | ~3–4 (thread budget + a spare core) |
| `7`          | 7                             | ~7–8 |

> **Why no CPU limit here either?** The whole point of I/O threads is to let
> Redis saturate the cores you've given it under peak load. A CPU limit would
> throttle exactly the workload you enabled threading for — turning a
> throughput win into latency and timeouts. Set the CPU *request* to the thread
> budget so the scheduler reserves those cores, and leave the limit off.

**Version note:** On Redis 8+, enabling `io-threads` threads both reads and
writes automatically. The Redis 6.x/7.x `io-threads-do-reads` toggle is obsolete
on Redis 8 and should be omitted — reads are always threaded when `io-threads > 1`.

**When to reach for this:** only when an instance is actually CPU-bound on
network I/O (high ops/sec, large values, or TLS). For most instances the
single-threaded default is faster to reason about and wastes no reserved cores.

## Large-Scale Tuning

For installations with hundreds or thousands of instances, you can tune the reconciliation frequency to reduce pressure on the Kubernetes API server and the Redis nodes.

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `requeueIntervals.fast` | `2s` | Interval used during initialization, recovery, or when the system is not 'Running'. |
| `requeueIntervals.steadyState` | `30s` | Interval used for periodic health checks once the system is stable ('Running'). |

**Example:**

```yaml
apiVersion: redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/v1alpha1
kind: LittleRed
metadata:
  name: tuned-cache
spec:
  mode: sentinel
  requeueIntervals:
    fast: "10s"
    steadyState: "1m"
```

## Cleanup

```bash
# Delete the LittleRed resource (cleans up all managed resources)
kubectl delete littlered store

# Verify cleanup
kubectl get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=store
# No resources found
```

---

## Troubleshooting

```bash
kubectl describe pod store-redis-0
```

### Redis logs

```bash
kubectl logs store-redis-0 -c redis
```

### Sentinel logs

```bash
kubectl logs store-sentinel-0
```

### Cluster diagnostics

```bash
# Check cluster state
kubectl exec -it store-shard-0-0 -c redis -- redis-cli CLUSTER INFO

# Check for failed slots
kubectl exec -it store-shard-0-0 -c redis -- redis-cli CLUSTER SLOTS

# View cluster topology
kubectl exec -it store-shard-0-0 -c redis -- redis-cli CLUSTER NODES

# Check stored cluster state in CR
kubectl get littlered store -o jsonpath='{.status.cluster.state}'

# Force cluster re-bootstrap (if cluster is broken)
# 1. Delete all cluster pods
kubectl delete pods -l app.kubernetes.io/instance=store,app.kubernetes.io/component=cluster
# 2. Clear stored state by patching CR
kubectl patch littlered store --type=merge -p '{"status":{"cluster":null}}'
# 3. Operator will re-bootstrap on next reconcile
```

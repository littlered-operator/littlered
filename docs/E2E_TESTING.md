# E2E Testing Guide

This guide explains how to run the LittleRed E2E test suite and perform manual chaos testing.

For the full list of test cases and their statuses, see [TEST_CASES.md](TEST_CASES.md).

---

## Overview

E2E tests verify the operator in a real Kubernetes cluster (Kind). They:

1. Create LittleRed CRs across all modes (standalone, sentinel, cluster)
2. Verify Kubernetes resources are created correctly (StatefulSets, Services, ConfigMaps)
3. Verify Redis is functional (PING, SET/GET, replication, cluster routing)
4. Test failover, crash recovery, rolling updates, and security features under load

---

## Prerequisites

- **Go 1.24+**
- **Kind** (Kubernetes in Docker)
- **Docker or Podman**
- **kubectl**

The Makefile manages everything else automatically: cluster creation, image builds, loading images into Kind, operator deployment, and teardown.

---

## Automated E2E Tests

### Quick Start

Run the full suite against a fresh Kind cluster:

```bash
make test-e2e
```

This automatically:
1. Creates a Kind cluster (`littlered-test-e2e`) if it doesn't exist
2. Builds the operator and chaos client images
3. Loads images into the Kind cluster
4. Deploys the operator via `make deploy`
5. Runs all e2e tests (`go test -tags=e2e ./test/e2e/ -timeout 60m`)
6. Tears down the Kind cluster (only if it was created by this run)

### Running Against an Existing Deployment

If the operator is already deployed (e.g., a pre-existing Kind cluster or remote cluster):

```bash
# Reuse existing Kind cluster, redeploy operator
make test-e2e SKIP_KIND_SETUP=true

# Reuse existing cluster and existing operator deployment
make test-e2e SKIP_KIND_SETUP=true SKIP_OPERATOR_DEPLOY=true
```

### Filtering Tests

Use `FOCUS` to run a subset of tests (passed to Ginkgo's `-focus` flag):

```bash
# Only standalone tests
make test-e2e FOCUS="Standalone"

# Only sentinel tests
make test-e2e FOCUS="Sentinel"

# Only cluster tests
make test-e2e FOCUS="Cluster Mode"

# Only failover tests
make test-e2e FOCUS="Failover"

# Only kill-9 / crash tests
make test-e2e FOCUS="Kill-9"

# Only security tests
make test-e2e FOCUS="Security"
```

### Additional Flags

Pass extra arguments to `go test` via `ARGS`:

```bash
make test-e2e ARGS="-timeout 90m"
```

## Reliable Cluster Verification (Lessons Learned)

Testing Redis Cluster state transitions is prone to race conditions due to the lag between Kubernetes actions (deleting a pod) and Redis internal state propagation (gossip). Several improvements were made to keep tests robust and non-flaky.

### The "Stale State" Problem

Redis Cluster gossip can take up to 15 seconds (`cluster-node-timeout`) to detect a failed node. If a test checks for health immediately after killing a pod, it might read **stale pre-failure state** from a node that hasn't noticed the failure yet, producing false positives.

### The "Too Fast Operator" Problem

The LittleRed operator uses Kubernetes as its source of truth and detects a missing pod almost instantly. It may `CLUSTER FORGET` a failed node and begin healing before a test's polling loop even sees the node in a `fail` or `pfail` state.

### Verification Best Practices

- **NodeID Tracking**: Always record the `NodeID` of a pod before performing chaos actions. Kubernetes pod names are stable (StatefulSet), but Redis NodeIDs are unique to the instance. Verification must ensure the *specific ID* has been replaced or forgotten.
- **Dynamic Ground Truth**: Helpers like `verifyClusterTopologySync` query the Redis ground truth (`CLUSTER NODES`) **inside** the `Eventually` loop, synchronizing with the cluster's evolution rather than a stale snapshot.
- **Robust Failure Detection**: The `waitForClusterFailureDetected` helper considers a failure "detected" if:
  1. A node is explicitly marked as `fail` or `pfail`
  2. **OR** the specific victim NodeID has disappeared from the mesh
  3. **OR** the total node count has decreased (indicating the operator already cleaned it up)
- **Shard Master Verification**: `waitForShardMasterChange(slot, oldNodeID)` waits until a specific hash slot is owned by a *different* master ID, proving that healing or promotion has actually occurred.

### Key Topology Guarantees

The E2E tests strictly validate the following cluster invariants after any failure:

1. **No Empty Masters**: Every master node must have slots assigned
2. **Correct Replica Count**: Every shard must have the expected number of healthy replicas
3. **Ghost Cleanup**: Nodes that no longer exist in K8s must be forgotten by the cluster gossip
4. **Data Integrity**: Chaos clients verify that every successful write can be read back, even during failover events

## Manual Chaos Testing

Manual chaos testing deploys a LittleRed CR and a continuous-load chaos client via Helm, then lets you inject faults while observing behavior in real time.

### Deploy the Test Environment

**Option A: Sentinel Mode** (3 Redis + 3 Sentinels + chaos client)

```bash
helm upgrade --install sentinel-investigation ./charts/sentinel-chaos \
  --set chaosClient.image.tag=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) \
  --namespace default

# Tear down
helm delete sentinel-investigation
```

**Option B: Cluster Mode** (3 shards × 2 replicas + chaos client)

```bash
helm upgrade --install cluster-investigation ./charts/cluster-chaos \
  --set chaosClient.image.tag=$(git rev-parse --short HEAD) \
  --namespace default

# Tear down
helm delete cluster-investigation
```

### Monitor the System

Open multiple terminal windows (or use `tmux`):

```bash
# Window 1: Operator logs
kubectl logs -n littlered-system -l control-plane=controller-manager --tail=-1 -f

# Window 2: Chaos client — throughput, availability, data integrity
kubectl logs manual-chaos-chaos-client -f

# Window 3: Redis pod logs (one per pod or loop)
while true; do kubectl logs manual-chaos-redis-0 -f; sleep 1; done         # sentinel
while true; do kubectl logs manual-chaos-cluster-0 -f; sleep 1; done       # cluster

# Window 4: Sentinel logs (sentinel mode only)
while true; do kubectl logs manual-chaos-sentinel-0 -f; sleep 1; done

# Window 5: CR status
while true; do kubectl get littlereds.chuck-chuck-chuck.net manual-chaos -o wide; sleep 1; done
```

### Inject Faults

```bash
# Kill the current master (sentinel mode) — find it first:
kubectl get pods -l chuck-chuck-chuck.net/role=master

# Graceful delete (triggers preStop hook and Sentinel FAILOVER)
kubectl delete pod <master-pod>

# Crash delete (force, no preStop — tests hard resilience)
kubectl delete pod <master-pod> --grace-period=0 --force

# Kill the Redis process in-pod (simulates OOM/kill-9)
kubectl exec <pod> -- kill -9 1

# Kill a shard master (cluster mode)
kubectl exec <cluster-pod> -- redis-cli CLUSTER NODES  # find a master
kubectl delete pod <master-cluster-pod> --grace-period=0 --force
```

**Scenarios to try:**
- Kill the master (sentinel) — expect failover within `downAfterMilliseconds`
- Kill master + replica in same shard simultaneously
- Kill 2 of 3 sentinel pods
- Rapid double kill (graceful then crash before the cluster settles)

**Recovery criteria:**
- **Sentinel**: cluster stabilizes, chaos client shows 0 data corruptions, `{name}-master` service routes to new master
- **Cluster**: all 16384 slots covered, 0 data corruptions, `cluster_state:ok`

### Observe with lrctl

```bash
# Verify topology health
lrctl verify <name>

# Watch CR status
lrctl describe <name>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Fail to Connect to Cluster

```bash
kubectl config current-context
kubectl get nodes
```

### Operator Not Running

```bash
kubectl logs -n littlered-system deployment/littlered-operator
kubectl get pods -n littlered-system
```

### Tests Timeout Waiting for Resources

The default timeout is 60 minutes. Increase it:

```bash
make test-e2e ARGS="-timeout 90m"
```

### Inspect Test Resources

```bash
kubectl get littlered -n littlered-e2e-test
kubectl get pods -n littlered-e2e-test
kubectl get svc -n littlered-e2e-test
```

### Clean Up After Interrupted Tests

Tests clean up after themselves, but if interrupted:

```bash
kubectl delete namespace littlered-e2e-test --ignore-not-found
kind delete cluster --name littlered-test-e2e
```

### Debug Artifacts

On test failure, debug artifacts (pod logs, operator logs, `lrctl` output) are written to:

```
debug-artifacts-<timestamp>-<test-name>/
```

in the project root.

# E2E Test Debug Artifacts

## Overview

When `DEBUG_ON_FAILURE=true` is set, failed e2e tests automatically collect comprehensive debug artifacts to help with post-mortem analysis.

## What Gets Collected

When a test fails, a timestamped directory is created in the current directory with the format:

```
./debug-artifacts-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<sanitized-test-name>/
```

This directory contains:

### 1. Operator Logs
- **File**: `operator-logs.txt`
- **Content**: Operator logs since the test started (filtered by `--since-time`)
- **Use**: Trace operator's decisions and actions during the test

### 2. CR Status
- **File**: `cr-<name>.yaml`
- **Content**: Full YAML representation of the LittleRed custom resource
- **Use**: See final state of spec and status, including node topology

### 3. Pod Logs
- **Files**: `pod-<podname>-<container>.log`
- **Content**: Last 1000 lines of logs from each container
- **Includes**: Redis/Valkey pods, Sentinel pods, previous logs if pod restarted
- **Use**: Debug application-level issues, see Redis cluster state changes

### 4. Chaos Client Logs (if applicable)
- **Files**: `chaos-client-<name>.log`, `chaos-metrics-<name>.json`
- **Content**: Chaos client output and metrics
- **Use**: Analyze availability, data corruption, performance during chaos tests

### 5. Cluster State
- **Files**: `pods.txt`, `events.txt`, `littlered-crs.yaml`, `statefulsets.yaml`, `services.yaml`
- **Content**: Kubernetes resource states at time of failure
- **Use**: See pod status, events, resource configuration

### 6. Test Metadata
- **File**: `test-metadata.txt`
- **Content**: Test name, namespace, CR name, timing, failure location and message
- **Use**: Quick reference for what failed and when

## Usage

### Running Tests with Debug Collection

```bash
# Enable debug artifact collection
DEBUG_ON_FAILURE=true make test-e2e

# Or with individual test
DEBUG_ON_FAILURE=true go test -tags e2e -v ./test/e2e -ginkgo.focus="should heal cluster"
```

### What Happens on Failure

1. Test fails
2. AfterEach hook detects failure
3. Artifacts are collected automatically
4. Directory path is printed to console
5. Test continues (namespace cleanup is skipped)

### Analyzing Artifacts

After a test fails:

```bash
# Find the debug directory
ls -lt debug-artifacts-* | head -1

# Look at test metadata first
cat debug-artifacts-*/test-metadata.txt

# Check operator decision-making
grep "Reconciling cluster mode" debug-artifacts-*/operator-logs.txt

# See final CR status
cat debug-artifacts-*/cr-*.yaml

# Check Redis cluster state
grep "cluster_state" debug-artifacts-*/pod-*-redis.log
```

## Integration Details

### Automatic Collection

The collection happens automatically in `e2e_suite_test.go`:

```go
var _ = AfterEach(func() {
    if CurrentSpecReport().Failed() && debugOnFailure {
        namespace, crName, chaosPod := extractTestContext()
        CollectDebugArtifacts(namespace, crName, chaosPod)
    }
})
```

### Context Detection

The system attempts to extract namespace, CR name, and chaos pod name from:

1. Spec labels (if set manually)
2. Spec path heuristics (e.g., "Cluster Mode Chaos" → `littlered-cluster-chaos-test`)

Most of the time, this works automatically without any manual labeling.

## Troubleshooting

### No artifacts collected

- Verify `DEBUG_ON_FAILURE=true` is set
- Check that the test actually failed (not skipped)
- Ensure you have write permissions in the current directory

### Missing logs

- Operator logs: Check that operator is running and accessible
- Pod logs: Pods may have been deleted before collection (timing issue)
- Chaos logs: Chaos pod may have completed and been removed

### Permissions

The debug artifact collection uses `kubectl` commands, so ensure your kubeconfig has appropriate permissions to:

- Get pods and logs
- Read custom resources
- List events and services

## Cleaning Up

Debug artifact directories are NOT automatically deleted. Clean them up manually:

```bash
# Remove old artifacts
rm -rf debug-artifacts-*

# Keep only recent artifacts
ls -t debug-artifacts-* | tail -n +6 | xargs rm -rf  # Keep 5 most recent
```

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:

- Automatic retention policy (keep last N)
- Tarball creation for easier sharing
- Upload to S3/GCS for CI integration
- Comparison tool for before/after states
- Integration with test reporting frameworks

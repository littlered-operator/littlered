cut a release (`scripts/prepare-release.sh`).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Default `redis_exporter` sidecar image is now **v1.89.0** (from v1.88.0). Instances
  that do not pin `metrics.exporter.tag` pick the new tag up when the CRD is applied.

- Dependency updates: prometheus-operator apis 0.93.1 and Ginkgo 2.32.1. CI-only:
  the lint workflow now uses `azure/setup-helm@v5`.

### Fixed

- **Both container images were being built by a Go release candidate.** The
  Dependabot `golang` group moved the operator and chaos-client builders from
  `golang:1.26.5` to `golang:1.27rc2`: a Docker tag like `1.27rc2` has no semver
  pre-release separator, so it ranks above the stable line instead of being skipped.
  `go.mod` still declared `go 1.26.0`, so the language version never moved, but the
  published images were compiled by a pre-release toolchain. Both builders are pinned
  to `golang:1.26.6` (the current stable patch), and the `golang` group now ignores
  minor and major updates — patch-level security fixes stay automatic, while moving
  the Go line stays a deliberate change made together with the `go` directive.

- **The Helm chart did not parse** — `helm install`/`helm upgrade` failed with
  `parse error at (littlered/templates/rolebinding.yaml:16): unexpected {{end}}`
  for **every** chart version from 0.2.2 on. Making leader election
  non-configurable removed the `{{- if .Values.leaderElection.enabled }}` guard
  from `role.yaml` and `rolebinding.yaml`, but the namespace-scoping change
  (ADR-014) was integrated with the guard's closing `{{- end }}` left behind in
  both files, closing nothing. `values.yaml` likewise carried a duplicated
  `scope:` block. Charts 0.2.2 and 0.3.0 have been republished with the fix.
- **CI now lints and renders the chart** (`make helm-lint`, run on every push and
  again before the release job pushes to the registry) in the default,
  allow-list and deny-list scoping modes. A chart template error is invisible to
  the Go linter and previously only surfaced on the user's cluster.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-11

Everything below has landed since `v0.2.2`. The headline is a restructure of
cluster mode — one StatefulSet per shard instead of a single striped one — which
unlocks per-shard failure-domain isolation. **Existing cluster instances migrate
automatically, online and without data loss; no action is required.** The
external contract is unchanged: same CRD API, same Services, service names,
ports and selectors, so client connection endpoints keep working untouched.
Standalone and sentinel mode are unaffected by the restructure.

### Added

- **Automatic in-place migration of pre-0.3 cluster instances** (ADR-013,
  LR-025). Instead of refusing to manage a legacy `{name}-cluster` StatefulSet,
  the operator migrates it to the per-shard layout online, on the same running
  Redis Cluster, without data loss and without changing client connection
  endpoints. The mechanism is **replicate-then-failover**: the new per-shard pods
  join as slot-less replicas of the legacy master owning their range, full-sync,
  and only then is `{name}-shard-K-0` promoted by a coordinated `CLUSTER
  FAILOVER` — an atomic handoff after which the legacy master demotes to a live
  replica. A new node therefore never owns slots without a redundant copy
  existing, which makes the migration restart-safe for every
  `replicasPerShard`, including `0`.
  - Phases, re-derived from live cluster state every reconcile (nothing
    load-bearing is persisted): `Standup` → `Meet` → `Replicate` → `Failover` →
    `Decommission` → `Complete`. The steady-state repair loop is suspended while
    a migration is in flight.
  - Entry is health-gated (`cluster_state:ok`, all 16384 slots assigned, all
    legacy pods `Ready`, master quorum) and **shape-preserving only** — the same
    `shards × (1 + replicasPerShard)`, which is what makes the 1:1
    range-for-range mapping valid. An unhealthy legacy cluster simply waits and
    migrates once it recovers. A legacy topology that does *not* match the
    declared shape is refused rather than guessed at: the instance reports
    `Phase=Failed` with a `LegacyClusterTopology` condition and needs operator
    attention. The legacy workload is never deleted in that case — with EmptyDir
    storage, deleting it would destroy data.
  - The legacy StatefulSet and its PDB are deleted only once no legacy node owns
    a single slot — i.e. provably holds no data.
  - Opt out per-CR with the annotation
    `redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/migrate-legacy-sts: hold`, which parks a
    non-mutating holding state for a maintenance window. Note the trade-off:
    while held, the repair loop stays suspended, so the instance is unmanaged.
  - Progress is observable via `status.cluster.migration`
    (`phase`, `shardsMoved`, `totalShards`, `startedAt`), and `lrctl status` /
    `lrctl verify` print a one-line migration banner while it is underway.
    Non-migrating output is unchanged, and `lrctl` remains read-only.
  - Legacy detection is deliberately narrow: a StatefulSet qualifies only if it
    is named `{name}-cluster`, carries `component=cluster`, **lacks** the
    per-shard label, is sized exactly `shards × (1 + replicasPerShard)`, and is
    controller-owned by this CR. A stray, mis-sized or half-formed StatefulSet
    never triggers a migration.

  Verified end-to-end on a live cluster for the Redis 8.4+ atomic-slot-migration
  engine and for the pre-8.4 path, including a restart-during-migration chaos
  tier.

- **`spec.placement.shardAntiAffinity` — per-shard failure-domain isolation as a
  one-line setting** (LR-022). The operator injects a `topologySpreadConstraint`
  (`maxSkew: 1`, selector scoped to that shard's pods) into each shard
  StatefulSet, appended after anything in
  `spec.podTemplate.topologySpreadConstraints`. Users could not write this
  themselves, because it has to select on the operator-owned shard label.
  Defaults are `topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname` and
  `whenUnsatisfiable: ScheduleAnyway` (soft, matching CloudNativePG/Strimzi
  convention); hard `DoNotSchedule` is opt-in. Cluster mode only. Enabling it
  triggers one serialized rollout that re-places the pods.

- **Cluster mode: recovery from a total-/partial-wipe deadlock** (LR-023,
  ADR-008) — the cluster analog of the sentinel leaderless deadlock. A mass
  container crash (`kill -9`, OOM) leaves `nodes.conf` on the EmptyDir, so every
  restarted master parks in the startup yield loop with no live replica to take
  over, lands in `CrashLoopBackOff`, and never becomes `Ready` — which meant the
  operator, gated on all pods being ready, never gathered state or acted. It now
  recycles exactly the stuck pods (redis container not ready, crash-looping, not
  `OOMKilled`) after a 120s cooldown tracked in
  `status.cluster.wipeDeadlockSince`, and their StatefulSets reschedule them
  fresh into the normal self-heal path. Data-safe by construction: the gate is
  the kubelet's *local* readiness probe rather than a remote dial, and a
  not-ready pod in a pure in-memory cluster holds no data. A `Ready` pod — a
  possible data holder — is never recycled, so a partial wipe keeps its
  survivor. Requires `delete` on pods (granted by the chart).

- **Sentinel mode: operator-led recovery from the ghost-master failover
  deadlock** (LR-024). A graceful failover followed by a crash could leave every
  Sentinel pinned to a dead master with an empty replica list —
  `-failover-abort-no-good-slave` forever, data safe but the instance never
  serving. Neither existing rule could help: ghost-master correction needs a
  living consensus master (every pod was a slave of the ghost) and Rule L needs
  bare Sentinels (these monitor the ghost). The operator now elects the
  most-complete survivor via `SENTINEL REMOVE` + `MONITOR` (+ `REPLICAOF NO
  ONE`), gated on `!HasHealthyKnownReplica` and a 30s cooldown
  (`status.ghostMasterStuckSince`) so a legitimate in-progress failover is never
  stolen. The safety gate keys on replication **lineage**, not holder count:
  same-lineage survivors are elected with no opt-in, while genuinely divergent
  histories still require `sentinel.allowUnsafeRebootstrapOnDeadlock`.

- **`lrctl verify`: shard-colocation checking and a `[DEGRADED]` tier**
  (LR-020). `verify` previously green-lit a cluster whose Redis shards were
  scrambled across StatefulSets, because it only checked Redis health. It now
  fails on any cross-StatefulSet master/replica pairing, and reports a new
  `[DEGRADED]` warning tier (exit 0) when a replica's replication link is down —
  reduced redundancy is not "healthy and consistent", but it is usually a
  transient resync, so it warns rather than fails.

### Changed

- **Cluster mode: one StatefulSet per shard** (LR-020, ADR-007). The
  single striped `{name}-cluster` StatefulSet is replaced by `{name}-shard-K`
  (one per shard, each sized `1 + replicasPerShard`), carrying a stable
  `redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/shard` label; shard K's intended master is pod
  `{name}-shard-K-0`, and each redundant shard gets its own
  `{name}-shard-K-pdb`. Pod enumeration and master identity now come from a
  single source of truth instead of the old `(i - shards) % shards` striping.
  The shared headless Service `{name}-cluster` is retained and governs every
  shard StatefulSet, so peer discovery, pod DNS and **client connection
  endpoints are unchanged**.

  This is what makes single-domain-loss survivability possible at all: a shard's
  master and replicas can only be placed in different failure domains if they
  live in separate StatefulSets. Because OSS Redis/Valkey Cluster has no
  failure-domain awareness, the operator is now the sole topology authority — an
  empty pod is reattached to the under-replicated master **in its own shard**
  (cross-shard only as a logged fallback), and
  `cluster-allow-replica-migration no` stops Redis from autonomously re-pairing
  replicas across shards.

  Two never-delete-data guards: the operator refuses to stand up per-shard
  StatefulSets beside a lingering legacy one (without deleting it), and refuses a
  decrease of `spec.cluster.shards` that would orphan high-index shards.

  **Upgrade note — no action required.** Existing instances are migrated
  automatically and online by the migration described under *Added*: no
  delete-and-recreate, no data loss, and no change to the client-facing contract
  (CRD API, Services, ports and selectors are all unchanged). The one visible
  difference is that **workload and pod names change**
  (`{name}-cluster-N` → `{name}-shard-K-M`, and `{name}-cluster-pdb` →
  `{name}-shard-K-pdb`), so anything referencing them *directly* — scripts,
  dashboards, NetworkPolicies, `kubectl rollout restart` invocations — needs
  updating. While a migration runs, the instance reports `Ready=False` with
  reason `MigrationInProgress` until it reaches `Complete`, which is worth
  knowing for anything that gates on readiness (CI checks, Argo CD health).

- **Rolling updates are serialized across shard StatefulSets** (LR-021).
  Splitting into per-shard StatefulSets lost the global one-pod-at-a-time
  restart ordering that a single StatefulSet provided for free: an
  operator-driven pod-template change rolled every shard in parallel and
  restarted all masters in one wave (the chaos e2e measured ~24% failed
  operations, no data loss). The operator now rolls one shard at a time,
  deferring the next until the current one has fully settled, detecting changes
  via a new `redis.chuck-chuck-chuck.net/pod-spec-hash` annotation on the
  operator-authored pod template. Creating missing shards stays immediate and
  parallel, so a fresh bootstrap is not slowed down. This governs
  operator-triggered rollouts only — a manual `kubectl rollout restart` bypasses
  the operator. On first upgrade, existing shard StatefulSets acquire the hash
  through one serialized, availability-safe roll.

- Event recording migrated to the `events.k8s.io/v1` API, replacing the
  deprecated core-`v1` recorder (`SA1019`, which 0.2.2 silenced with a scoped
  `//nolint`). The new broadcaster requires `events.k8s.io` `create`/`patch`
  permissions, added to the generated RBAC and to the shared chart RBAC helper
  used by both the cluster- and namespace-scoped roles.

- Upgrade and install documentation corrected. The cluster-mode upgrade note
  still described the superseded clean-slate, delete-and-recreate behavior,
  which would have led upgrading users to destroy data for an upgrade that is
  now seamless; it now documents the automatic migration, its phases and the
  `hold` opt-out with its trade-off. Also fixed: a false "exactly 3 shards /
  0 or 1 replica" claim (validation allows 3+ shards and 0+ replicas),
  rolling-restart commands that still targeted the no-longer-existing
  `{name}-cluster` StatefulSet, and a stale install section (OCI chart install,
  correct image/CRD paths; the Kustomize option is gone, since Helm is the
  distribution).

- `golangci-lint` is pinned to v2.12.2 via the `go.mod` tool directive, matching
  what CI runs, so local `make lint` and CI now surface the same findings. All 56
  newly-surfaced findings were resolved by introducing or reusing constants — no
  value or logic changes.

- Topology-aware master balancing (spreading *masters* across failure domains)
  is explicitly **declined** and recorded as a contestable decision with revisit
  conditions in ADR-009: reads commonly go to replicas so load is already
  spread, `replicasPerShard: 1` leaves no balancing freedom, there is no
  schedule-time master label to spread on, and active balancing would only add
  failover churn without improving uptime.

### Fixed

- **Sentinel seeding could silently no-op against a stale master.** The
  idempotency guard skipped any Sentinel that already knew *some* master, which
  during a ghost-master deadlock is the ghost — and a bare `SENTINEL MONITOR` is
  rejected while a same-named master is still configured, so the repoint did
  nothing and recovery oscillated. It now skips only Sentinels already
  monitoring the *target* master (preserving no-churn idempotency) and otherwise
  issues `SENTINEL REMOVE` before `MONITOR`, so the repoint actually reaches a
  ghost-pinned Sentinel. Bootstrap and leaderless seeding are unaffected.

- **A normal promotion chain was misread as divergent data.** When a node is
  promoted and its peers resync, Redis rotates `master_replid` and shifts the
  previous value into `master_replid2`. Divergence was computed from
  `master_replid` alone, so the survivors of a graceful-then-crash sequence
  looked like independent lineages and recovery refused to elect any of them.
  The gather now also captures `master_replid2`, and divergence is computed over
  each holder's `{replid, replid2}` with union-find, so holders connected through
  a shared replication id count as one lineage. Only genuinely independent
  histories are reported as divergent and still require the unsafe opt-in.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-08-11

Everything below has landed since `v0.2.1`.

### Added

- **Namespace-scoped operation** (ADR-014). The operator can now be restricted to
  a subset of namespaces instead of always reconciling every `LittleRed` CR in the
  cluster. Two mutually-exclusive, opt-in modes:
  - `WATCH_NAMESPACE` — allow-list. The manager cache watches only those
    namespaces, and the Helm chart renders a per-namespace manager `Role` +
    `RoleBinding` instead of a `ClusterRole` (least privilege).
  - `IGNORE_NAMESPACE` — deny-list. Watches everything except those namespaces
    (cache field selector); keeps the `ClusterRole`.

  Both unset means cluster-scoped, exactly as before; setting both is a fatal
  startup error. The leader-election lease ID is derived from the effective scope,
  so operators with disjoint scopes never contend for the same lease. Configure via
  the chart values `scope.watchNamespaces` / `scope.ignoreNamespaces`. The CRD stays
  cluster-installed. See the *Namespace Scoping* section in
  [`docs/USAGE.md`](docs/USAGE.md).

- **Cluster mode: self-healing of the consolidated-shard deadlock** (LR-018,
  ADR-006). An instance where one master owned two or more shard ranges while other
  masters sat slotless could stay in `phase: Initializing` indefinitely — no repair
  step could act. The operator now detects this (Step 3b) and relocates the surplus
  range onto an empty master, **preserving keys unconditionally**:
  - Redis 8.4+ (detected at gather time from `CLUSTER INFO`, nothing persisted):
    native atomic slot migration (`CLUSTER MIGRATION IMPORT`).
  - Older engines: the classic `IMPORTING`/`MIGRATING` → `MIGRATE` → `SETSLOT NODE`
    dance, made incremental across reconciles so it never blocks the reconcile
    worker, resuming from the cluster's own on-node markers (no operator state).

  The root cause is also closed: a missing shard range may now only be assigned to
  a reachable *empty* master, so recovery can never pile a second range onto a
  master that already owns one. New advanced tunables under `spec.cluster`:
  `reshardKeyBatchSize` (128), `reshardMaxKeysPerReconcile` (2000),
  `reshardMigrateTimeoutMillis` (5000) — ignored on the native 8.4+ path.

- **Sentinel mode: recovery from a leaderless bootstrap deadlock** (LR-015,
  ADR-005). After a mass pod restart, an already-initialized instance whose entire
  Sentinel quorum lost its master config was unrecoverable without manual
  `SENTINEL MONITOR` or a CR delete + redeploy: with no master, every healing rule
  short-circuited. The new Rule L fires only on that exact signature (all reachable
  Sentinels bare, reachable quorum, no disruption in flight, state persisted past a
  30s cooldown) and decides by how many reachable pods still hold keys:
  - **0 holders** → seed `redis-0` as master.
  - **exactly 1 holder** → promote it (the sole surviving copy of the data; nothing
    else can be lost). No opt-in required; reported as `ReseededFromSurvivor`.
  - **2 or more holders** → refuse and wait, because electing one discards the
    others. Set `spec.sentinel.allowUnsafeRebootstrapOnDeadlock: true` to force-elect
    the most complete pod (highest replication offset, keys as tiebreak).

  Observability: new `LeaderlessRecovery` status condition, `status.leaderlessSince`,
  Kubernetes Events (the operator now needs — and the chart grants — `events` RBAC),
  and per-pod key counts in `lrctl verify` / `lrctl status`.

- **Metrics for Sentinel pods and replicas** (#6). The `redis_exporter` sidecar was
  missing from the Sentinel pods, so they emitted no metrics at all. They now carry
  a sidecar pointed at port 26379 (`redis_sentinel_*` series), and the Sentinel
  headless service exposes the metrics port with the `prometheus.io` annotations.
  Additionally, in sentinel mode the metrics port moved from the role-scoped master
  service to the all-pods replicas headless service, so master *and* replicas are
  each scraped exactly once (previously only the master was scraped). The existing
  `ServiceMonitor` picks both services up automatically.

- **Admission-time rejection of mode-mismatched specs** (#61). CEL
  `x-kubernetes-validations` on `LittleRedSpec` now make the apiserver reject a CR
  that carries `spec.cluster` when `spec.mode` is not `cluster`, or `spec.sentinel`
  when the mode is not `sentinel`. Previously the mismatched block was silently
  ignored.

- **Scheduling: `topologySpreadConstraints` for the operator Deployment**, as a new
  Helm chart value (rendered only when set), so a multi-replica operator can be
  spread across nodes and zones. `docs/USAGE.md` gained a *Spreading pods across
  nodes and failure domains* section covering the `spec.podTemplate` passthrough for
  managed instances.

- **Release tooling.** `scripts/prepare-release.sh` promotes `[Unreleased]` to a
  versioned section and bumps the Helm chart version; [`RELEASING.md`](RELEASING.md)
  documents the process; the publish workflow now generates the GitHub Release notes
  from the matching changelog section instead of a hardcoded body, and verifies the
  chart version matches the tag before publishing.

- **Licensing artifacts.** Apache-2.0 `LICENSE`, `AUTHORS`, `NOTICE` with upstream
  attributions, a generated `THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES` inventory with a `make licenses`
  target, and the collective `Copyright <year> The littlered Authors.` header across
  all Go sources.

- **E2E test selection.** Heavy or opt-in specs carry a shared Ginkgo `extended`
  label: `make test-e2e` runs everything except those, `make test-e2e-all` (or
  `E2E_ALL=true`) runs the lot, and `LABEL_FILTER` accepts any Ginkgo label
  expression. New coverage for reshard recovery (native and pre-8.4 paths) and for
  leaderless recovery.

### Changed

- Leader election is now always enabled and is no longer configurable. The
  operator manager hardcodes `LeaderElection: true`, the `--leader-elect`
  command-line flag has been removed, and the Helm chart's
  `leaderElection.enabled` value has been removed. This guarantees that only
  one controller manager reconciles at a time regardless of how the deployment
  is scaled (via Helm or directly with `kubectl`/`k9s`), preventing concurrent
  reconcilers from racing over Sentinel master/failover state. The
  leader-election RBAC (Role/RoleBinding) is now rendered unconditionally.

  **Upgrade note:** installs that previously set `leaderElection.enabled: false`
  will have leader election forced on at the next `helm upgrade`. This is the
  intended hardening and requires no action, but the now-unknown
  `leaderElection.enabled` value should be removed from custom `values.yaml`
  files to avoid confusion.

- **BREAKING: PodDisruptionBudgets for managed instances are created by default**
  (#69). `spec.podDisruptionBudget.create` is now a `*bool` with a CRD-level
  `default: true`, so the default lives in the OpenAPI schema and is materialized on
  the object at admission. Opt out per-CR with `create: false`. The
  `--pdb-create-default` operator flag and its chart wiring are **removed** — with a
  CRD default they were redundant. The chart's top-level `podDisruptionBudget` values
  block now governs only the operator Deployment's own PDB.

  **Upgrade note:** the new CRD must be applied for the new default to take effect.
  Upgrading only the operator image against an old CRD is safe but leaves the feature
  inert for CRs that omit `create`. `helm upgrade` does not upgrade CRDs in the
  chart's `crds/` directory, so Helm users must apply the CRD manually.

- Default `redis_exporter` sidecar image is now **v1.88.0**. The version has a single
  Dependabot-tracked source of truth (`api/v1alpha1/redis-exporter.Dockerfile`,
  `go:embed`-ed and parsed) instead of being hardcoded across Go constants, the
  kubebuilder default marker and the generated CRD, with a drift guard test that
  fails CI if a bump is not mirrored into the marker + `make manifests`.

- **Documentation now matches the project's actual resource conventions.** Example
  manifests no longer set CPU *limits* (they contradicted both the operator's
  convention and production practice), and the rationale was rewritten: Redis's CPU
  use is bounded by its thread budget (main thread + `io-threads`), so the CPU
  *request* should be sized to that budget while a CPU *limit* can only throttle
  Redis into rising latency and cascading timeouts. Claims of "Guaranteed QoS by
  default" corrected to Burstable (memory limit = request, no CPU limit). Also adds
  PodDisruptionBudget coverage (`docs/USAGE.md` example, `docs/API_SPEC.md` field
  reference, production samples) and stops presenting `sentinel.quorum: 2` as
  something to set — it is the default.

- **Makefile targets follow kubebuilder conventions.** `install`/`uninstall` now
  mean apply/delete the CRDs (the old lrctl-installing `install` is
  `install-lrctl`); canonical `docker-build`/`docker-push` driven by a new `IMG`
  variable, which `deploy` also honors; `img-buildx` renamed `docker-buildx`; default
  `CONTAINER_TOOL` is `docker` (override via env). The Helm `deploy`/`undeploy` path
  and the two-image e2e build set are kept as deliberate divergences. Makefile tool
  versions (controller-gen, golangci-lint, go-licenses) are now derived from `go.mod`
  `tool` directives so Dependabot can see them.

- Helm chart: namespaced resources now carry an explicit `namespace` in their
  templates, and the repository URL in `Chart.yaml` was corrected. Manager RBAC rules
  are generated into a single shared template helper so the `ClusterRole` and the
  namespaced `Role` cannot drift.

- Dependency updates: Kubernetes libraries 0.36.2 with controller-runtime 0.24.1,
  `go-redis` 9.22.0, prometheus-operator apis 0.93.0, Ginkgo 2.32.0 / Gomega 1.42.1,
  `logr` 1.4.4, Go 1.26.5 and Alpine 3.24.1 base images, plus `golang.org/x/text`
  0.39.0 and `google.golang.org/grpc` 1.82.1 to pick up security fixes.

- Internal maintenance: migrated off deprecated APIs (`client.Apply` (#32),
  controller-runtime's `scheme.Builder`), adopted Go 1.26's `new(expr)` builtin in
  place of pointer helpers, and cleaned up lint findings across the operator, `lrctl`
  and tests. No behavior change.

### Fixed

- **Sentinel mode: a reconcile could stall ~146s on dead pod IPs** (LR-017), on
  clouds where a killed pod's IP blackholes rather than refusing connections. The
  stall froze status at a stale value and starved the leaderless-recovery rule, which
  surfaced as apparent data loss in recovery testing. The sentinel gather now probes
  all Redis and Sentinel pods concurrently (as cluster mode already did), and every
  Sentinel read-path address loop plus the gatherer's Redis probe is bounded by a
  per-address `ProbeTimeout` (3s), so a dead address fails in ≤3s regardless of
  client retries. This is the sentinel-mode completion of LR-012.

- **Sentinel mode: the Redis liveness probe could wipe the last surviving copy of
  the data** (LR-016). The probe restarted any replica whose master was unreachable,
  intending to self-heal replicas following a ghost master — but a pod's local `INFO`
  cannot distinguish that case from a leaderless survivor, and since storage is
  EmptyDir the restart destroyed exactly the data leaderless recovery exists to
  preserve. The probe is now a plain local health check (bootstrap guard + local
  `PING`), matching standalone and cluster mode; topology repair stays
  operator-owned (`SLAVEOF` redirect without a restart). Readiness is unchanged and
  still gated on `link:up`, so a masterless replica is pulled from traffic without
  being killed.

- **Sentinel mode: ghost-replica `SENTINEL RESET` could deadlock a failover**
  (LR-013). After a force-deleted master, a broadcast `RESET` wiped Sentinel's
  replica list, which can only be rebuilt from the (now permanently dead) master's
  `INFO` — leaving Sentinel monitoring a dead IP with no known replicas and aborting
  failover indefinitely. The destructive ghost-replica `RESET` is now additionally
  gated on cluster wholeness (every expected Redis pod reachable, computed from
  already-gathered ground truth); when not whole the operator defers, since a stale
  ghost entry is harmless and is pruned on a later reconcile. Ghost-master
  correction, divergent-master correction and replica rescue still run during
  disruption.

- **Cluster mode: a restarted pod returning as an empty master could take minutes to
  reattach** (LR-014). Health was computed from slot-owning masters only, so an
  empty master still read "healthy": the operator dropped to the 30s steady cadence
  right when it needed the 2s healing cadence, and transient `ERR Unknown node`
  failures compounded. Empty masters now count as unhealthy, and `CLUSTER REPLICATE`
  is deferred until the empty master actually knows the target's node ID (using
  adjacency data already gathered — no extra round-trips).

- **Cluster mode: one stale pod IP could stall the whole reconcile loop** (LR-012).
  Ground-truth gathering dialed every pod IP serially with a 5s dial timeout and
  client-side retries, so each dead IP blocked ~25s and rapid pod churn starved the
  loop of the iterations needed to forget ghosts, re-`MEET` survivors and reassign
  replicas. Gathering now fans out concurrently with a hard 3s per-probe deadline,
  and `CLUSTER FORGET` skips unreachable nodes.

- **Cluster mode: `CLUSTER NODES` parsing counted migration markers as owned slots**
  (LR-018). The `[slot->-id]` / `[slot-<-id]` notations that appear mid-migration
  were parsed as slots, which made a range unparseable on the source and made an
  importing destination look like a slot-owning master — enough for the operator to
  declare the cluster healthy and abandon a reshard halfway, stranding keys on a node
  that did not own the slots. Latent until the reshard dance became the first code
  path to mark slots.

- **No PodDisruptionBudget is created for single-pod workloads** (#92). A PDB over a
  single pod can only ever block node drains and never protect availability. This
  now applies to standalone instances, cluster instances with
  `replicasPerShard: 0`, and — in the chart — the operator's own Deployment while it
  runs a single replica. Reconciliation also cleans up a PDB left behind by an
  earlier default-on version.

- The operator's own PDB template rendered both `minAvailable` and `maxUnavailable`,
  which is an invalid PDB spec. It now renders `minAvailable` when set (taking
  precedence, matching the operator's own resolution) and otherwise `maxUnavailable`,
  defaulting to 1.

- The Sentinel-monitor StatefulSet silently dropped `priorityClassName` and
  `topologySpreadConstraints` while the other three builders honored them; all four
  now propagate the full `spec.podTemplate` scheduling surface. The production sample's
  topology-spread `labelSelector` was also fixed — it selected on
  `app.kubernetes.io/name`, which is the constant `littlered`, so it matched no pods;
  the per-instance discriminator is `app.kubernetes.io/instance`.

- `.gitignore` matched the bare path component `littlered`, so new files under
  `charts/littlered/` and `cmd/littlered/` were silently ignored (existing files
  stayed tracked only because they predated the pattern). The pattern is now anchored
  to the repository root build binary.
